Those Beavs aren't such\nbad boys!  -K\n\n\n\n\nInteresting reading from someone calling himself \"Grackle\" on the Beaver\nDam at Beaver Sport Central.  Here's what he had to say regarding the\nPrescott\ntrial:\n\nI've attended much of the trial and here are the pertinent facts:\n\n1. Victor Becerra, the accuser/victim: (a) lied about how much he drank\nthat night-- for example he told the attending doctor at Good Sam (where he\nhad\nhis battered face treated) that he'd had half a beer that night. He also\ntold the grand jury that he'd had \"at most a beer\" before going over to\nthe party where the fight occurred. In fact, witnesses testified that he'd\none\nbeer AND consumed at very potent mixed drink (a \"consuelo\")-- a consuelo\n(Corey here, El Presidente' makes the best consuelos in Corvallis)\nconsists of SIX shots of vodka mixed with juice or the like.\n\n2) Becerra also lied about not having struck any blows. Not only did he\nstrike blows, he struck FIRST and suffered the consequences. First,\nBecerra pushed Prescott after telling him that he and his \"boys\"\n(Prescott's\nfriends at the party-Junior Addams, Newsom, Weathersby) were't welcome at\nthe\nparty-Prescott then decked him AFTER more less pawing at Becerra twice to\nget him out of his face (in between Prescott's mild pawing at Becerra,\nBecerra taunted him by telling Prescott he hit like \"a bitch\").\nSubsequently, things died down for a minute or so, and then Becerra\nproceeded to ambush a VERY drunk Addams who, at that time, was bending\ndown to fix his shoe (previously, Addams had not been involved in any\nphysical\nconfrontation). Just exactly what did Becerra do to Adams? He grabbed him\nby the head and kneed him in the face-knocking Adams down and splitting his\nlip. Then, all hell broke loose-with many people fighting each other and\nwith Becerra getting the worst of it -- kicked and punched. ALL of these\nfacts are in the testimony from reliable witnesses and the DA doesn't even\ndeny any longer that Becerra was the aggressor.\n\n3) My conclusion: First, Becerra only got what he asked for by kneeing\nAdams in the face with no provocation from Addams. The fact that Addams'\nfriends\nbeat the heck out of Becerra for the cheapshot was the risk Becerra took\nfor cheapshotting Adams in the first place. Charges should NEVER have been\nbrought (the thing was a brawl started by Becerra), but since they were,\nwhy wasn't Becerra charged with assault as well?\n\n4) A coach today told me that this case has already hurt recruiting-the\nword's out that Corvallis will go after blacks and prosecute them before\nrunning a really thorough investigation. I agree-this case should NEVER\nhave been prosecuted and since it was, why weren't the non-blacks involved\ncharged as well?? This is something we all need to be concerned about. I\nintend to write the District Attorney (Heiser) expressing my opinion on\nthe matter.\n\n\nCorey Neistadt\nDiLorenzo, Hess & Company, PC\ncoreyn@dilohess.com\n(503) 646-6696 ext. 214\nFax (503) 626-2032\n\n\n\n\n\n","content":"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nReturn-Path: <karen.mcnulty@usbank.com>\nReceived: from  rly-zc03.mx.aol.com (rly-zc03.mail.aol.com [172.31.33.3]) by \nair-zc01.mail.aol.com (v77_r1.21) with ESMTP; Wed, 28 Feb 2001 12:19:01 -0500\nReceived: from  mx02.usbank.com ([156.36.240.14]) by rly-zc03.mx.aol.com \n(v77_r1.21) with ESMTP; Wed, 28 Feb 2001 12:18:21 -0500\nReceived: from 10.207.4.79 by mx02.usbank.com with SMTP (Tumbleweed MMS SMTP \nRelay (MMS v4.7)); Wed, 28 Feb 2001 09:19:22 -0800\nX-Server-Uuid: 1e505468-1c7e-11d4-a4f6-0050da14be60\nReceived: from 10.88.32.240 by ntorccmx01.or.usbc.com with ESMTP (USBANK (MMS \nv4.7)); Wed, 28 Feb 2001 09:20:33 -0800\nX-Server-Uuid: 9fbd4b68-d59c-11d3-ab85-0004ac4c2802\nSubject: Prescott Case\nTo: christian.c.casebeer@tek.com, DChristian@pclient.ml.com,        \nandycox815@hotmail.com, kac5575@hotmail.com, erikdietz@yahoo.com,        \nrgenor@hotmail.com, LillahMay@aol.com, mcnultyleepatty@sprintmail.com,        \nMatthew.Neff@phs.com, julie.podhora@usbank.com, lrodrigu@pcc.edu,        \njason.rosario@codesic.com, woods@pacifier.com\nX-Mailer: Lotus Notes Release 5.0.3  March 21, 2000\nMessage-ID: <OF38035772.44D40EDE-ON88256A01.005ED39B@or.usbc.com>\nFrom: karen.mcnulty@usbank.com\nDate: Wed, 28 Feb 2001 09:17:02 -0800\nX-MIMETrack: Serialize by Router on NTZTWREM04/OR/Servers/USB(Release 5.0.5 \n|September 22, 2000) at 02/28/2001 09:17:04 AM\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nX-WSS-ID: 1683ECEB397571-01-01\nX-WSS-ID: 1683EC9018875-01-01\nContent-Type: text/plain;  charset=us-ascii\n\n\n","messageId":"<31493955.1075840716754.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-03-01T05:40:00+05:30","from":"lillahmay@aol.com","subject":"Fwd: Prescott Case","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"LillahMay@aol.com","xTo":"ryanb@gosfgiants.com, mark.guzman@enron.com, EHowieMaster@aol.com, lauren@mattandlauren.com, kauz@qwest.net, rniles@conmet.com, jsanders@albanychamber.com","xFolder":"\\mark guzman 6-28-02\\Notes Folders\\Notes inbox","xOrigin":"GUZMAN-M","xFileName":"mark guzman 6-28-02.nsf","to":"ryanb@gosfgiants.com,mark.guzman@enron.com,ehowiemaster@aol.com,lauren@mattandlauren.com,kauz@qwest.net,rniles@conmet.com,jsanders@albanychamber.com"}

Even if you\ncould give me the $4,000 left over after paying him $6,000 it would help.\nI'm kinda in a jam right now (between you and I) and I have some stuff I\nneed to pay. I still owe Jay $5,500 for my car that he put on a credit card,\nand I have $4,000 of it, but if I give it all to him, that leaves me pretty\nbroke. $27,000 of my money is stuck in my loan with the credit union, I paid\nmom like $2,000, paid off my credit, and have been making 2 car payments and\n2 insurance payments since I still have the Neon. Even if you can only give\nme the $4,000 or even half of that...anything would help. I didn't know if\nyou were still keeping that $10,000 for me or not, if you're not let me\nknow.
