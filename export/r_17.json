The volume\nof trading was exceptionally low and price ranges tightened across every\ntrading hub, usually with the low end coming up to meet the high.  \"Heavy\nload volume went way down, but I'm at a loss as to why off-peak demand\ncontinued to trade,\" mumbled one bewildered player.  One analyst speculated\nthat with daytime highs near comfortable levels, \"heating demand should only\nbe kicking in at night.\"  The market did indeed appear unusual throughout\nthe West on Friday.  Contrary to norms, power at Palo Verde and South Path\nsold at a premium to Mid-Columbia pieces.  One possible factor for this\nanomaly could be the de-rating of the California-Oregon Intertie from\nbetween three- and four-thousand megawatts to 600 MW for scheduled\nmaintenance, which will last through October 28.  \"This could have\neffectively isolated the Pacific Northwest with lower load demands and\nnear-normal generating capacity, only with nobody to whom to export,\" one\nanalyst postulated.  While NYMEX made up for Thursday's losses, spot gas\nprices at the Southern California border fell by almost 25 cents on Friday.\nThe Henry Hub natural gas contract for November climbed 10.3 cents to close\nat 3.041$/mmBtu, while December gas trailed along, gaining 8 cents on Friday\n's trades to close at 3.183$/mmBtu.\n\nOn Friday, Mid-Columbia peak power traded at a discount to power in the\nSouthwest.  Heavy load pieces traded in a tight range, between 31.5 to\n33.4$/MWh on Friday, and this included the usual premium that comes with\ntrading three days out. One player speculated that the lack of volatility at\nMid-Columbia was due to the \"loss of transmission capacity at the\nCalifornia-Oregon Intertie.\"  Temperatures were forecast to hover near\nnormal in the Northwest through the weekend, with reservoir-building\nprecipitation called for on Friday, Monday and Tuesday.  The latest\nsix-to-ten predicted near-to-above normal temperatures would prevail from\nNovember 1 to 5, which suggested that daytime heating demand would not be\nlikely in the week-and-a-half to come.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph held\nsteady at 45 kcfs for Saturday, 40 kcfs Sunday, 65 kcfs from Monday through\nThursday, and 60 kcfs on Friday.  No specific unit news was forthcoming,\nalthough aggregate output of northwest hydro units was reportedly down by\nover 1400 MW due to curtailed flows.\n\nGolden State electricity prices were mostly flat for the Sunday/Monday\npackage to Thursday, with off-peak prices edging up on the usual all-day\nSunday premium.  Light load energy costs at SP15 and NP15 climbed 2.1 and\n3$/MWh, respectively.  SP15 prices were seen at a slight premium to NP15 in\na light trading session, as many players sat on the sidelines, covering\ntheir loads, but otherwise out of the spot market.  In political news,\nCalifornia's State Board of Equalization voted to switch tax jurisdiction of\npower plants from the local to the state level in 2003.  The state reported\nit will tax the plants based on \"fair market share\", and predicted that more\nrevenues will be raised under the new system.   Also in the news, California\nwill not build new transmission lines, used to import power from neighboring\nstates Nevada and Arizona, until at least 2008.  The generation landscape\nwas little changed on Friday.  The Shasta hydro units (526 MW) were\ncompletely off-line.  \"The reservoirs are probably too low to support any\ngeneration right now,\" speculated one analyst.  Temperatures in California\nwere expected to range from the low-70s to low-50s through Tuesday,\nproducing little weather-related electricity demand in the state.  Keeping\nhope for more demand in the near future down, the latest six-to-ten from the\nNWS called for normal temperatures from November 1 to 5.\n\nSouthwest peak power was a hot commodity in the WSCC on Friday.  Peak goods\nfor Monday delivery fluctuated between 33 and 36.5$/MWh at Palo Verde, which\nboasted a higher volume of trade than its neighboring hubs.  Some players\nspeculated that the \"Palo premium\" was based on high natural gas prices that\ncaused many California gas-fired plants to remain dormant and buy power from\noutside the state.  \"Without the California-Oregon Intertie, nobody could\naccess Northwest hydropower, so everybody lined up at Palo Verde and SP-15,\"\ncommented one seasoned marketer.  Temperatures ranged from the high 80s in\nPhoenix to the mid-60s in Salt Lake City, with forecasts calling for\ntemperatures to continue to hover just above normal through Tuesday.  The\nlatest six-to-ten extended the above-normal forecast through November 5.  On\nthe generation front, Navajo #1 (750 MW) returned to the grid on Thursday\nnight as expected after completing water pump repairs.\n\nDavid Ramberg and Jessie Norris\n_________________________________________________________\n\nWestern Generating Unit Outages\n\nCurrent                            Begins          Ends          Reason\nCAISO units <250/6308 total          NA             NA\nplanned/unplanned*\nAlamitos #3/320/gas               20-Oct-01         ?            planned\nBridger #2/520/coal               24-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nBridger #3/520/coal               24-Oct-01      27-Oct-01       tube leak\nComanche #2/335/coal              29-Sep-01      30-Oct-01       maintenance\nContra Costa #7/337/gas           01-Sep-01         ?            planned\nEl Segundo #3/337/gas             02-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nEtiwanda #3/320/gas               05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nHelms PGP #2/407/hydro            01-Oct-01         ?            planned\nHyatt/Thermalito/900/hydro        02-Oct-01         ?        @ 250MW,\nplanned\nLos Medanos/550/gas               19-Oct-O1         ?        @ 250MW,\nplanned\nOrmond Beach #2/750/gas           05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nPalo Verde #2/1270/nuke           10-Oct-01      30 days         maintenance\nPalo Verde #3/1270/nuke           29-Sep-01      03-Nov-01\nrefuel/maint.\nRedondo #7/480/gas                23-Oct-01         ?            planned\nSan Juan #4/534/coal              20-Oct-01      07-Nov-01       maintenance\n\nFor unit owners refer to pdf version.\n*Indicates a change from previous EMR.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nEastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)\n\nOctober 26, 2001 for October 29, 2001\n\nPeak (Heavy) in $/MWh\n                 Low     Change   High      Change\nInto Cinergy    31.00     2.50    32.50     -1.45\nWestern PJM     31.40     1.90    32.90      1.75\nInto Entergy    25.55     0.30    29.00      1.00\nInto TVA        30.00     0.00    34.50      2.75\n___________________________________________________________\nIn an active Friday trading session, peak power prices for Monday delivery\nstrengthened across the Eastern Interconnect on cooler weather and\nincreasing natural gas prices.  \"This week the power markets are following\ngas up.  Some Hubs, like Entergy, were simply too cheap before, and those\nhave made particularly strong gains,\" opined one market analyst.  The\nmercury dropped all across the East Friday, and was expected to remain in\nthe nippy range through Tuesday.  Forecasts were calling for daytime highs\nonly in the 40s and 50s, and overnight lows in the downright chilly 20s and\n30s were expected.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas contracts traded actively on Friday,\na day ahead of expiring November contracts on Monday.   November climbed\n10.3 cents to close at 3.041$/mmBtu, and December also edged up 8 cents to\nend at 3.183$/mmBtu.\n\nHeavy load energy costs in the Mid-Atlantic rose in Friday trade, amid\nhigher predicted loads for Monday and strong natural gas markets.\nGeneration was healthier on Friday, with off-line Megawatts dropping.  Nuke\nIndian Point #2 (965 MW) was off-line, entering a 20 day maintenance outage,\nand rumors indicated that Peach Bottom #2 (1,152 MW) might have returned to\nthe grid a day ahead of schedule on Friday.  Western PJM goods were trading\nfrom 31.4 to 32.9$/MWh. With a mean of 22.5$/MWh through 15:00 EDT, LMPs\nwere very stable on Friday, fluctuating within 4$/MWh of the average all day\nafter the usual early-morning spike.  Overnight lows in the 30s were\nexpected through Tuesday of the new week, kicking up heating demand.\nNonetheless, the latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal\ntemperatures from November 1 to 5.\n\nLike the rest of the Eastern spot market, peak power prices in the Midwest\nwere natural gas dependent on Friday. No new outages were reported and gas\ncosts were expected to outweigh weather-related demand for the new week.\nElectricity prices edged down slightly, with Into Cinergy goods changing\nhands between 31 and 32.5$/MWh, losing 1.45$/MWh on the high end, but\ntightening the range on the low.  The Midwest was expected to be the coldest\nregion over the weekend and into the new week, with temperatures not\nexpected to reach any higher than 59 degrees through Tuesday, with overnight\nlows in the 20s and 30s.  However, the latest six-to-ten predicted\nabove-normal temperatures from November 1 to 5.\n\nIn the Southeast on Friday trading was particularly active, with heavy load\nelectricity prices gaining ground yet again, as a brief bout of winter\nweather was expected for the new week and strong natural gas costs pushed\nprices higher.  Into Entergy pieces traded between 25.55 and 29$/MWh, with\nthe day's low seen right out of the gate and the high reached late in the\nsession.  Some market players mentioned that cash gas (inside the month\ntrades) were really moving the Entergy market on Friday.  Into TVA was a\nless liquid market, with deals done between 30 and 34.5$/MWh.  Temperatures\nwere expected well below normal through Tuesday, with overnight lows solidly\nin the 30s.  The weather trend was expected to reverse though, with\nabove-normal temperatures predicted from November 1 to 5.\n___________________________________________________________\nCalifornia ISO Congestion Index in $/MWh\n\n\n                         Path                 Peak   Off-peak\nfor 27-Oct-01         NW1 to NP15             0.00     0.00\n                      NW3 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      AZ3 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      LC1 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      SP15 to NP15            0.00     0.00\n\n\n\nOTC Forward Peak Electricity Contracts in $/MWh\n\n               Mid-C            PV             SP-15\n           Bid      Ask     Bid     Ask     Bid     Ask\nBOM       34.25    34.75   34.25   34.75   34.75   35.00\nNovember  35.25    35.75   32.75   33.00   34.00   34.50\nDecember  42.50    43.00   36.25   36.75   38.00   38.50\nQ1 '02    38.00    39.00   35.00   36.00   37.25   37.75\nQ2 '02    28.50    29.50   37.50   38.75   37.00   37.50\nQ3 '02    46.00    47.00   55.00   57.00   51.25   52.00\nQ4 '02    40.00    41.00   37.25   38.25   40.50   41.25\nCal '03   42.00    42.25   42.00   43.00   43.50   45.00\n\n\n\nRepresents the most recent bid/ask spread obtainable\nby the Energy Market Report.\n\n\n\nAlberta Power Pool Index (C$/MWh)\n\n                    Peak(14)   Peak(16)   Off-Peak       Flat    Change\nfor  25-Oct-01       62.27      61.90      32.56         53.01    12.45\n\n\n\nBPA's Offer in $/MWh\n\nHours     Amount          NW               COB           NOB\n\n\nBPA has no offer until further notice.\n\n\n\nNYMEX Henry Hub Gas Futures in $/mmBtu\n\n                 Close        Change\n        Nov      3.041         0.103\n        Dec      3.183         0.080\n\n\n\nNatural Gas Spot Prices in $/mmBtu\n\n                  Low          High\nSumas             2.57         2.62\nSo.

The volume\nof trading was exceptionally low and price ranges tightened across every\ntrading hub, usually with the low end coming up to meet the high.  \"Heavy\nload volume went way down, but I'm at a loss as to why off-peak demand\ncontinued to trade,\" mumbled one bewildered player.  One analyst speculated\nthat with daytime highs near comfortable levels, \"heating demand should only\nbe kicking in at night.\"  The market did indeed appear unusual throughout\nthe West on Friday.  Contrary to norms, power at Palo Verde and South Path\nsold at a premium to Mid-Columbia pieces.  One possible factor for this\nanomaly could be the de-rating of the California-Oregon Intertie from\nbetween three- and four-thousand megawatts to 600 MW for scheduled\nmaintenance, which will last through October 28.  \"This could have\neffectively isolated the Pacific Northwest with lower load demands and\nnear-normal generating capacity, only with nobody to whom to export,\" one\nanalyst postulated.  While NYMEX made up for Thursday's losses, spot gas\nprices at the Southern California border fell by almost 25 cents on Friday.\nThe Henry Hub natural gas contract for November climbed 10.3 cents to close\nat 3.041$/mmBtu, while December gas trailed along, gaining 8 cents on Friday\n's trades to close at 3.183$/mmBtu.\n\nOn Friday, Mid-Columbia peak power traded at a discount to power in the\nSouthwest.  Heavy load pieces traded in a tight range, between 31.5 to\n33.4$/MWh on Friday, and this included the usual premium that comes with\ntrading three days out. One player speculated that the lack of volatility at\nMid-Columbia was due to the \"loss of transmission capacity at the\nCalifornia-Oregon Intertie.\"  Temperatures were forecast to hover near\nnormal in the Northwest through the weekend, with reservoir-building\nprecipitation called for on Friday, Monday and Tuesday.  The latest\nsix-to-ten predicted near-to-above normal temperatures would prevail from\nNovember 1 to 5, which suggested that daytime heating demand would not be\nlikely in the week-and-a-half to come.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph held\nsteady at 45 kcfs for Saturday, 40 kcfs Sunday, 65 kcfs from Monday through\nThursday, and 60 kcfs on Friday.  No specific unit news was forthcoming,\nalthough aggregate output of northwest hydro units was reportedly down by\nover 1400 MW due to curtailed flows.\n\nGolden State electricity prices were mostly flat for the Sunday/Monday\npackage to Thursday, with off-peak prices edging up on the usual all-day\nSunday premium.  Light load energy costs at SP15 and NP15 climbed 2.1 and\n3$/MWh, respectively.  SP15 prices were seen at a slight premium to NP15 in\na light trading session, as many players sat on the sidelines, covering\ntheir loads, but otherwise out of the spot market.  In political news,\nCalifornia's State Board of Equalization voted to switch tax jurisdiction of\npower plants from the local to the state level in 2003.  The state reported\nit will tax the plants based on \"fair market share\", and predicted that more\nrevenues will be raised under the new system.   Also in the news, California\nwill not build new transmission lines, used to import power from neighboring\nstates Nevada and Arizona, until at least 2008.  The generation landscape\nwas little changed on Friday.  The Shasta hydro units (526 MW) were\ncompletely off-line.  \"The reservoirs are probably too low to support any\ngeneration right now,\" speculated one analyst.  Temperatures in California\nwere expected to range from the low-70s to low-50s through Tuesday,\nproducing little weather-related electricity demand in the state.  Keeping\nhope for more demand in the near future down, the latest six-to-ten from the\nNWS called for normal temperatures from November 1 to 5.\n\nSouthwest peak power was a hot commodity in the WSCC on Friday.  Peak goods\nfor Monday delivery fluctuated between 33 and 36.5$/MWh at Palo Verde, which\nboasted a higher volume of trade than its neighboring hubs.  Some players\nspeculated that the \"Palo premium\" was based on high natural gas prices that\ncaused many California gas-fired plants to remain dormant and buy power from\noutside the state.  \"Without the California-Oregon Intertie, nobody could\naccess Northwest hydropower, so everybody lined up at Palo Verde and SP-15,\"\ncommented one seasoned marketer.  Temperatures ranged from the high 80s in\nPhoenix to the mid-60s in Salt Lake City, with forecasts calling for\ntemperatures to continue to hover just above normal through Tuesday.  The\nlatest six-to-ten extended the above-normal forecast through November 5.  On\nthe generation front, Navajo #1 (750 MW) returned to the grid on Thursday\nnight as expected after completing water pump repairs.\n\nDavid Ramberg and Jessie Norris\n_________________________________________________________\n\nWestern Generating Unit Outages\n\nCurrent                            Begins          Ends          Reason\nCAISO units <250/6308 total          NA             NA\nplanned/unplanned*\nAlamitos #3/320/gas               20-Oct-01         ?            planned\nBridger #2/520/coal               24-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nBridger #3/520/coal               24-Oct-01      27-Oct-01       tube leak\nComanche #2/335/coal              29-Sep-01      30-Oct-01       maintenance\nContra Costa #7/337/gas           01-Sep-01         ?            planned\nEl Segundo #3/337/gas             02-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nEtiwanda #3/320/gas               05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nHelms PGP #2/407/hydro            01-Oct-01         ?            planned\nHyatt/Thermalito/900/hydro        02-Oct-01         ?        @ 250MW,\nplanned\nLos Medanos/550/gas               19-Oct-O1         ?        @ 250MW,\nplanned\nOrmond Beach #2/750/gas           05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nPalo Verde #2/1270/nuke           10-Oct-01      30 days         maintenance\nPalo Verde #3/1270/nuke           29-Sep-01      03-Nov-01\nrefuel/maint.\nRedondo #7/480/gas                23-Oct-01         ?            planned\nSan Juan #4/534/coal              20-Oct-01      07-Nov-01       maintenance\n\nFor unit owners refer to pdf version.\n*Indicates a change from previous EMR.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nEastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)\n\nOctober 26, 2001 for October 29, 2001\n\nPeak (Heavy) in $/MWh\n                 Low     Change   High      Change\nInto Cinergy    31.00     2.50    32.50     -1.45\nWestern PJM     31.40     1.90    32.90      1.75\nInto Entergy    25.55     0.30    29.00      1.00\nInto TVA        30.00     0.00    34.50      2.75\n___________________________________________________________\nIn an active Friday trading session, peak power prices for Monday delivery\nstrengthened across the Eastern Interconnect on cooler weather and\nincreasing natural gas prices.  \"This week the power markets are following\ngas up.  Some Hubs, like Entergy, were simply too cheap before, and those\nhave made particularly strong gains,\" opined one market analyst.  The\nmercury dropped all across the East Friday, and was expected to remain in\nthe nippy range through Tuesday.  Forecasts were calling for daytime highs\nonly in the 40s and 50s, and overnight lows in the downright chilly 20s and\n30s were expected.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas contracts traded actively on Friday,\na day ahead of expiring November contracts on Monday.   November climbed\n10.3 cents to close at 3.041$/mmBtu, and December also edged up 8 cents to\nend at 3.183$/mmBtu.\n\nHeavy load energy costs in the Mid-Atlantic rose in Friday trade, amid\nhigher predicted loads for Monday and strong natural gas markets.\nGeneration was healthier on Friday, with off-line Megawatts dropping.  Nuke\nIndian Point #2 (965 MW) was off-line, entering a 20 day maintenance outage,\nand rumors indicated that Peach Bottom #2 (1,152 MW) might have returned to\nthe grid a day ahead of schedule on Friday.  Western PJM goods were trading\nfrom 31.4 to 32.9$/MWh. With a mean of 22.5$/MWh through 15:00 EDT, LMPs\nwere very stable on Friday, fluctuating within 4$/MWh of the average all day\nafter the usual early-morning spike.  Overnight lows in the 30s were\nexpected through Tuesday of the new week, kicking up heating demand.\nNonetheless, the latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal\ntemperatures from November 1 to 5.\n\nLike the rest of the Eastern spot market, peak power prices in the Midwest\nwere natural gas dependent on Friday. No new outages were reported and gas\ncosts were expected to outweigh weather-related demand for the new week.\nElectricity prices edged down slightly, with Into Cinergy goods changing\nhands between 31 and 32.5$/MWh, losing 1.45$/MWh on the high end, but\ntightening the range on the low.  The Midwest was expected to be the coldest\nregion over the weekend and into the new week, with temperatures not\nexpected to reach any higher than 59 degrees through Tuesday, with overnight\nlows in the 20s and 30s.  However, the latest six-to-ten predicted\nabove-normal temperatures from November 1 to 5.\n\nIn the Southeast on Friday trading was particularly active, with heavy load\nelectricity prices gaining ground yet again, as a brief bout of winter\nweather was expected for the new week and strong natural gas costs pushed\nprices higher.  Into Entergy pieces traded between 25.55 and 29$/MWh, with\nthe day's low seen right out of the gate and the high reached late in the\nsession.  Some market players mentioned that cash gas (inside the month\ntrades) were really moving the Entergy market on Friday.  Into TVA was a\nless liquid market, with deals done between 30 and 34.5$/MWh.

Some players also attributed a bit of the\ndaily strength to increased heating demand in the Northwest as the nights\ngrow longer and colder.  Spot gas at the Southern California Border made\nmore significant gains on Wednesday, with trades heard from 2.6 to\n2.65$/mmBtu, compared to Tuesday's range of 2.37 to 2.42$/mmBtu.  NYMEX\nHenry Hub gas contracts were on the rise early Wednesday due to cool weather\nforecasts and some technical buying, but ended sharply lower following the\nlate release of a bearish AGA inventory report.  November Hub gas ended down\n17.4 cents at 2.418$/MWh, after an early rise to a session high of\n2.69$/mmBtu.  December shed 14.9 cents to close at 2.703$/mmBtu.  Wednesday'\ns AGA report showed a build of 63 bcf in U.S. natural gas inventories last\nweek, above industry expectations and last year's 29-bcf gain.  Total U.S.\ninventories stood at 3.042 tcf, 471 bcf above the same week a year ago and\n267 bcf higher than the five-year average.  One gas trader commented, \"U.S.\nstocks are already above the end-of-October levels seen the past four out of\nfive years.\"  Of the 63 bcf injected last week, 12 bcf were injected in the\nWestern Consuming Region.  Total inventories in the West stood at 464 bcf,\ncompared to 378 bcf a year ago, and the five-year average of 384 bcf.\n\nBoth peak and off-peak spot electricity prices in the Northwest rose by as\nmuch as 4$/MWh on Wednesday.  The increase in off-peak prices was largely\nblamed on longer and colder fall nights, while the on-peak rise was\nattributed to lower hydro flows associated with the commencement of Vernita\nBar.  Originally scheduled to begin on October 14, Vernita Bar operations\nwere slated to begin at midnight on Thursday.  The yearly operations involve\ncurtailing flows during the daylight hours, while increasing them during the\nnighttime hours to ensure that salmon eggs remained covered with water.\n\"This is when we get into reverse load factoring,\" said one Northwest hydro\noperator.  \"We will probably only be able to generate about half as much\nduring the day as we can at night.\"  Historically, Vernita Bar operations\nresult in a narrowing of the peak and off-peak spread, as heavy load prices\nrise and light load prices fall.  However, as one marketer put it, \"People\noverreact to the start of Vernita Bar operations every year, but they need\nto remember that this is a shoulder month.\"  Vernita Bar operations are\nscheduled to be in place until November 22.  In unit news, reports indicated\nthat Wyoming-based Jim Bridger #4 (520 MW) was taken off line Wednesday for\nrepairs to a cooling tower.  Sources indicated that said repairs would last\nuntil October 20, and possibly longer.\n\nElectricity prices in the Golden State gained ground across the board in\nWednesday trade, with higher natural gas prices and more off-line megawatts\npropelling the cash market upward.  Peak power at COB changed hands in a\nnarrow range from 28.25 to 28.75$/MWh, while light load goods went for 23.25\nto 23.5$/MWh.  NP15 heavy load pieces transacted at prices from 27.75 to\n30$/MWh, while light load prices ranged from 25 to 26.5$/MWh.  SP15 peak\npower saw action between 29 and 30.75$/MWh, with off-peak power trading for\n21.25 to 26$/MWh.  Weather remained warm on Wednesday, with temperatures in\nthe normal range.  Daytime highs were mostly in the high-60s to 70s, with\nsouthern inland areas seeing 80 degrees.  Temperatures were expected to\nremain at current levels through Sunday, while the latest six-to-ten called\nfor below-normal temperatures for the entire state from October 23 to 27.\nOn the unit front, the ISO reported that the gas-fired Sunrise (338 MW) unit\nwas down for planned reasons.  Los Medanos (550 MW) was running at 125 MW,\nand Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) was curtailed to 350 MW.\n\nAmid rising natural gas values, peak power prices rose in the desert\nSouthwest for Thursday delivery, but their gains paled in comparison to\nthose realized for the off-peak hours.  Heavy load energy at Palo gained as\nmuch as 3.15$/MWh, with confirmed transactions between 27.5 and 31.5$/MWh,\nand unconfirmed transactions as high as 32.5$/MWh.  Meanwhile, light load\ngoods at Palo Verde gained as much as 6.5$/MWh for the day, and Mead rose as\nmuch as a whopping 8.75$/MWh.  Four Corners #4 (750 MW) remained off line\nWednesday afternoon, after coming down for tube leak repairs last weekend.\nSources expected the unit to return to service late Wednesday night or early\non Thursday.  Further to the north, Wyoming-based LRS #3 (550 MW) came down\naround 12:00 PDT Wednesday, though no cause or ETR were available at the\ntime of this writing.  Additionally, sources indicated that Colorado-based\nCraig #1 (428 MW) would operate at about half capacity until further notice\nfor unspecified reasons.\n\n\n\nPatrick O'Neill and Jessie Norris\n_________________________________________________________\n\nWestern Generating Unit Outages\n\nCurrent                            Begins          Ends          Reason\nCAISO units <250/5517 total          NA             NA\nplanned/unplanned*\nAlamitos #3/320/gas               06-Oct-01         ?        @20MW,planned*\nBridger #4/520/coal               17-Oct-01      20-Oct-01       repairs*\nComanche #2/335/coal              29-Sep-01      30-Oct-01       maintenance\nContra Costa #7/337/gas           01-Sep-01         ?            planned\nCrockett Cogen/260/gas            15-Oct-01         ?            planned\nEl Segundo #3/337/gas             02-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nEncina #5/332/gas                 17-Oct-01         ?        @70MW,\nunplanned*\nEtiwanda #3/320/gas               05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nEtiwanda #4/320/gas               05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nFour Corners #4/750/coal          12-Oct-01      17-Oct-01       unplanned\nHelms PGP #2/407/hydro            01-Oct-01         ?            planned\nHyatt/Thermalito/900/hydro        02-Oct-01         ?        @ 250MW,\nplanned\nLos Medanos/550/gas               17-Oct-01         ?        @ 125MW,\nplanned*\nLRS #3/550/coal                   17-Oct-01         ?            unknown*\nMoss Landing #6/739/gas           17-Oct-01         ?\n@350MW,unplanned*\nOrmond Beach #2/750/gas           05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nPalo Verde #2/1270/nuke           10-Oct-01      30 days         maintenance\nPalo Verde #3/1270/nuke           29-Sep-01      03-Nov-01\nrefuel/maint.\nSan Onofre #2/1070/nuke           14-Oct-01      02-Nov-01      maintenance\nSunrise Power Plant/338/gas       17-Oct-01         ?             planned*\n\nFuture\nSan Juan #4/534/coal              20-Oct-01      11-Nov-01      maintenance\n\nFor unit owners refer to pdf version.\n*Indicates a change from previous EMR.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nEastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)\n\nOctober 17, 2001 for October 18, 2001\n\nPeak (Heavy) in $/MWh\n                 Low     Change   High      Change\nInto Cinergy    21.50     0.35    23.35      1.35\nWestern PJM     26.00     1.30    27.00      1.40\nInto Entergy    20.50     1.65    21.45      0.85\nInto TVA        21.50     1.00    24.25      2.50\n___________________________________________________________\nPeak power prices across the Eastern Interconnect were up in Wednesday\ntrade, mainly on Tuesday's surge in natural gas prices, which continued into\nWednesday, and a busy cash market.  Weather across the regions remained\ncool, with daytime temperatures uniformly in the 50s and 60s.  Overnight\nlows dipped into the 30s and 40s, stimulating some heating demand,\nparticularly in the northern regions.  Nuclear outages were said to be at a\nminimum, with the only outages being units already down for autumn\nrefueling.  The AGA released its report on last week's natural gas\ninventories, reporting a slightly bearish 63-bcf injection.  NYMEX Henry Hub\nnatural gas contracts tumbled on that late-session news, with November\nclosing down 17.4 cents at 2.418$/mmBtu.  December slipped 14.9 cents to end\nat 2.703$/mmBtu.\n\nIn the Mid-Atlantic, heavy load energy costs climbed 1.5$/MWh on the high\nend, with Western PJM prices ranging from 26 to 27$/MWh for Thursday\ndelivery.  Most traders believed Salem #1 (1,106 MW) was supplying power to\nthe grid on Wednesday.  Off-line generation was pegged at just over 8,000\nMW, a decrease from Tuesday's 9,176 MW figure, which dovetailed nicely with\nthe presumed return of Salem #1.  LMPs leapt to 46$/MWh between 06:15 and\n07:00 EDT, before settling back down around the day's average of 22$/MWh.\nWeather in the region was cool on Wednesday, with temperatures 5 to 10\ndegrees below normal.  Daytime highs were expected to edge back into the 60s\nand 70s by the weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was\npredicting above-normal temperatures from October 23 to 27.\n\nAmid cool weather across the Midwest and brisker trading, peak power prices\nstrengthened on Wednesday.  Into Cinergy goods were exchanged for prices\nranging from 21.5 to 23.35$/MWh, an increase of 1.35$/MWh on the high end.\nDaytime temperatures across ECAR only reached highs in the low 50s, while\novernight temperatures in the 30s necessitated heating load.  However, the\njump in weather-related demand was expected to be short-lived, as\ntemperatures were predicted to be back in the upper-60s by the weekend and\nthe most current six-to-ten-day forecast called for normal to above-normal\ntemperatures from October 23 to 27.  Nuclear generation was thought to be\nhealthy, with the return of large unit Braidwood #1 (1,120 MW) from its fall\nrefueling outage.\n\nIn the Southeast, peak power prices for Thursday delivery increased as cool\nweather blanketed the regions, bringing overnight lows in the 30s and 40s.\nInto Entergy pieces traded in a tighter range to a day ago, between 20.5 and\n21.45$/MWh, gaining 0.85$/MWh on the high end.  Into TVA prices also surged\nhigher, with deals done between 21.5 and 24.25$/MWh.  No new nuclear outages\nwere known Wednesday.  Weather across SERC was brisk, with temperatures 10\nto 15 degrees below normal and overnight lows in the 30s.  Temperatures were\nexpected to climb by the weekend, and the latest six-to-ten called for\nabove-normal temperatures from October 23 through 27.\n___________________________________________________________\nCalifornia ISO Congestion Index in $/MWh\n\n\n                         Path                 Peak   Off-peak\nfor 18-Oct-01         NW1 to NP15             0.00     0.00\n                      NW3 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      AZ3 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      LC1 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      SP15 to NP15            0.00     0.00\n\n\n\nOTC Forward Peak Electricity Contracts in $/MWh\n\n                Mid-C            PV             SP-15\n            Bid     Ask     Bid     Ask     Bid      Ask\nBOM        25.00   26.00   27.25   27.75   28.00   28.50\nNovember   27.25   27.75   26.75   27.00   27.50   28.00\nDecember   35.25   36.00   30.75   31.50   32.50   33.50\nQ1 '02     33.75   34.25   31.75   32.25   33.00   33.50\nQ2 '02     27.50   28.75   35.75   36.75   34.00   34.50\nQ3 '02     44.00   46.00   51.75   52.75   47.50   48.25\nQ4 '02     36.50   37.75   35.50   36.00   36.75   37.50\nCal '03    38.75   39.50   39.25   41.50   42.00   43.25\n\nRepresents the most recent bid/ask spread obtainable\nby the Energy Market Report.\n\n\n\nAlberta Power Pool Index (C$/MWh)\n\n                    Peak(14)   Peak(16)   Off-Peak       Flat    Change\nfor  16-Oct-01       63.52      60.16      29.14        50.90     11.42\n\n\n\nBPA's Offer in $/MWh\n\nHours     Amount          NW               COB           NOB\n\n\nBPA has no offer until further notice.\n\n\n\nNYMEX Henry Hub Gas Futures in $/mmBtu\n\n                 Close        Change\n        Nov      2.418        -0.174\n        Dec      2.703        -0.149\n\n\n\nNatural Gas Spot Prices in $/mmBtu\n\n                  Low          High\nSumas             2.33         2.38\nSo.

Some players also attributed a bit of the\ndaily strength to increased heating demand in the Northwest as the nights\ngrow longer and colder.  Spot gas at the Southern California Border made\nmore significant gains on Wednesday, with trades heard from 2.6 to\n2.65$/mmBtu, compared to Tuesday's range of 2.37 to 2.42$/mmBtu.  NYMEX\nHenry Hub gas contracts were on the rise early Wednesday due to cool weather\nforecasts and some technical buying, but ended sharply lower following the\nlate release of a bearish AGA inventory report.  November Hub gas ended down\n17.4 cents at 2.418$/MWh, after an early rise to a session high of\n2.69$/mmBtu.  December shed 14.9 cents to close at 2.703$/mmBtu.  Wednesday'\ns AGA report showed a build of 63 bcf in U.S. natural gas inventories last\nweek, above industry expectations and last year's 29-bcf gain.  Total U.S.\ninventories stood at 3.042 tcf, 471 bcf above the same week a year ago and\n267 bcf higher than the five-year average.  One gas trader commented, \"U.S.\nstocks are already above the end-of-October levels seen the past four out of\nfive years.\"  Of the 63 bcf injected last week, 12 bcf were injected in the\nWestern Consuming Region.  Total inventories in the West stood at 464 bcf,\ncompared to 378 bcf a year ago, and the five-year average of 384 bcf.\n\nBoth peak and off-peak spot electricity prices in the Northwest rose by as\nmuch as 4$/MWh on Wednesday.  The increase in off-peak prices was largely\nblamed on longer and colder fall nights, while the on-peak rise was\nattributed to lower hydro flows associated with the commencement of Vernita\nBar.  Originally scheduled to begin on October 14, Vernita Bar operations\nwere slated to begin at midnight on Thursday.  The yearly operations involve\ncurtailing flows during the daylight hours, while increasing them during the\nnighttime hours to ensure that salmon eggs remained covered with water.\n\"This is when we get into reverse load factoring,\" said one Northwest hydro\noperator.  \"We will probably only be able to generate about half as much\nduring the day as we can at night.\"  Historically, Vernita Bar operations\nresult in a narrowing of the peak and off-peak spread, as heavy load prices\nrise and light load prices fall.  However, as one marketer put it, \"People\noverreact to the start of Vernita Bar operations every year, but they need\nto remember that this is a shoulder month.\"  Vernita Bar operations are\nscheduled to be in place until November 22.  In unit news, reports indicated\nthat Wyoming-based Jim Bridger #4 (520 MW) was taken off line Wednesday for\nrepairs to a cooling tower.  Sources indicated that said repairs would last\nuntil October 20, and possibly longer.\n\nElectricity prices in the Golden State gained ground across the board in\nWednesday trade, with higher natural gas prices and more off-line megawatts\npropelling the cash market upward.  Peak power at COB changed hands in a\nnarrow range from 28.25 to 28.75$/MWh, while light load goods went for 23.25\nto 23.5$/MWh.  NP15 heavy load pieces transacted at prices from 27.75 to\n30$/MWh, while light load prices ranged from 25 to 26.5$/MWh.  SP15 peak\npower saw action between 29 and 30.75$/MWh, with off-peak power trading for\n21.25 to 26$/MWh.  Weather remained warm on Wednesday, with temperatures in\nthe normal range.  Daytime highs were mostly in the high-60s to 70s, with\nsouthern inland areas seeing 80 degrees.  Temperatures were expected to\nremain at current levels through Sunday, while the latest six-to-ten called\nfor below-normal temperatures for the entire state from October 23 to 27.\nOn the unit front, the ISO reported that the gas-fired Sunrise (338 MW) unit\nwas down for planned reasons.  Los Medanos (550 MW) was running at 125 MW,\nand Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) was curtailed to 350 MW.\n\nAmid rising natural gas values, peak power prices rose in the desert\nSouthwest for Thursday delivery, but their gains paled in comparison to\nthose realized for the off-peak hours.

Four Corners #4 (750 MW) remained off line\nWednesday afternoon, after coming down for tube leak repairs last weekend.\nSources expected the unit to return to service late Wednesday night or early\non Thursday.  Further to the north, Wyoming-based LRS #3 (550 MW) came down\naround 12:00 PDT Wednesday, though no cause or ETR were available at the\ntime of this writing.  Additionally, sources indicated that Colorado-based\nCraig #1 (428 MW) would operate at about half capacity until further notice\nfor unspecified reasons.\n\n\n\nPatrick O'Neill and Jessie Norris\n_________________________________________________________\n\nWestern Generating Unit Outages\n\nCurrent                            Begins          Ends          Reason\nCAISO units <250/5517 total          NA             NA\nplanned/unplanned*\nAlamitos #3/320/gas               06-Oct-01         ?        @20MW,planned*\nBridger #4/520/coal               17-Oct-01      20-Oct-01       repairs*\nComanche #2/335/coal              29-Sep-01      30-Oct-01       maintenance\nContra Costa #7/337/gas           01-Sep-01         ?            planned\nCrockett Cogen/260/gas            15-Oct-01         ?            planned\nEl Segundo #3/337/gas             02-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nEncina #5/332/gas                 17-Oct-01         ?        @70MW,\nunplanned*\nEtiwanda #3/320/gas               05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nEtiwanda #4/320/gas               05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nFour Corners #4/750/coal          12-Oct-01      17-Oct-01       unplanned\nHelms PGP #2/407/hydro            01-Oct-01         ?            planned\nHyatt/Thermalito/900/hydro        02-Oct-01         ?        @ 250MW,\nplanned\nLos Medanos/550/gas               17-Oct-01         ?        @ 125MW,\nplanned*\nLRS #3/550/coal                   17-Oct-01         ?            unknown*\nMoss Landing #6/739/gas           17-Oct-01         ?\n@350MW,unplanned*\nOrmond Beach #2/750/gas           05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nPalo Verde #2/1270/nuke           10-Oct-01      30 days         maintenance\nPalo Verde #3/1270/nuke           29-Sep-01      03-Nov-01\nrefuel/maint.\nSan Onofre #2/1070/nuke           14-Oct-01      02-Nov-01      maintenance\nSunrise Power Plant/338/gas       17-Oct-01         ?             planned*\n\nFuture\nSan Juan #4/534/coal              20-Oct-01      11-Nov-01      maintenance\n\nFor unit owners refer to pdf version.\n*Indicates a change from previous EMR.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nEastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)\n\nOctober 17, 2001 for October 18, 2001\n\nPeak (Heavy) in $/MWh\n                 Low     Change   High      Change\nInto Cinergy    21.50     0.35    23.35      1.35\nWestern PJM     26.00     1.30    27.00      1.40\nInto Entergy    20.50     1.65    21.45      0.85\nInto TVA        21.50     1.00    24.25      2.50\n___________________________________________________________\nPeak power prices across the Eastern Interconnect were up in Wednesday\ntrade, mainly on Tuesday's surge in natural gas prices, which continued into\nWednesday, and a busy cash market.  Weather across the regions remained\ncool, with daytime temperatures uniformly in the 50s and 60s.  Overnight\nlows dipped into the 30s and 40s, stimulating some heating demand,\nparticularly in the northern regions.  Nuclear outages were said to be at a\nminimum, with the only outages being units already down for autumn\nrefueling.  The AGA released its report on last week's natural gas\ninventories, reporting a slightly bearish 63-bcf injection.  NYMEX Henry Hub\nnatural gas contracts tumbled on that late-session news, with November\nclosing down 17.4 cents at 2.418$/mmBtu.  December slipped 14.9 cents to end\nat 2.703$/mmBtu.\n\nIn the Mid-Atlantic, heavy load energy costs climbed 1.5$/MWh on the high\nend, with Western PJM prices ranging from 26 to 27$/MWh for Thursday\ndelivery.  Most traders believed Salem #1 (1,106 MW) was supplying power to\nthe grid on Wednesday.  Off-line generation was pegged at just over 8,000\nMW, a decrease from Tuesday's 9,176 MW figure, which dovetailed nicely with\nthe presumed return of Salem #1.  LMPs leapt to 46$/MWh between 06:15 and\n07:00 EDT, before settling back down around the day's average of 22$/MWh.\nWeather in the region was cool on Wednesday, with temperatures 5 to 10\ndegrees below normal.  Daytime highs were expected to edge back into the 60s\nand 70s by the weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was\npredicting above-normal temperatures from October 23 to 27.\n\nAmid cool weather across the Midwest and brisker trading, peak power prices\nstrengthened on Wednesday.  Into Cinergy goods were exchanged for prices\nranging from 21.5 to 23.35$/MWh, an increase of 1.35$/MWh on the high end.\nDaytime temperatures across ECAR only reached highs in the low 50s, while\novernight temperatures in the 30s necessitated heating load.  However, the\njump in weather-related demand was expected to be short-lived, as\ntemperatures were predicted to be back in the upper-60s by the weekend and\nthe most current six-to-ten-day forecast called for normal to above-normal\ntemperatures from October 23 to 27.  Nuclear generation was thought to be\nhealthy, with the return of large unit Braidwood #1 (1,120 MW) from its fall\nrefueling outage.\n\nIn the Southeast, peak power prices for Thursday delivery increased as cool\nweather blanketed the regions, bringing overnight lows in the 30s and 40s.\nInto Entergy pieces traded in a tighter range to a day ago, between 20.5 and\n21.45$/MWh, gaining 0.85$/MWh on the high end.  Into TVA prices also surged\nhigher, with deals done between 21.5 and 24.25$/MWh.  No new nuclear outages\nwere known Wednesday.  Weather across SERC was brisk, with temperatures 10\nto 15 degrees below normal and overnight lows in the 30s.  Temperatures were\nexpected to climb by the weekend, and the latest six-to-ten called for\nabove-normal temperatures from October 23 through 27.\n___________________________________________________________\nCalifornia ISO Congestion Index in $/MWh\n\n\n                         Path                 Peak   Off-peak\nfor 18-Oct-01         NW1 to NP15             0.00     0.00\n                      NW3 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      AZ3 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      LC1 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      SP15 to NP15            0.00     0.00\n\n\n\nOTC Forward Peak Electricity Contracts in $/MWh\n\n                Mid-C            PV             SP-15\n            Bid     Ask     Bid     Ask     Bid      Ask\nBOM        25.00   26.00   27.25   27.75   28.00   28.50\nNovember   27.25   27.75   26.75   27.00   27.50   28.00\nDecember   35.25   36.00   30.75   31.50   32.50   33.50\nQ1 '02     33.75   34.25   31.75   32.25   33.00   33.50\nQ2 '02     27.50   28.75   35.75   36.75   34.00   34.50\nQ3 '02     44.00   46.00   51.75   52.75   47.50   48.25\nQ4 '02     36.50   37.75   35.50   36.00   36.75   37.50\nCal '03    38.75   39.50   39.25   41.50   42.00   43.25\n\nRepresents the most recent bid/ask spread obtainable\nby the Energy Market Report.\n\n\n\nAlberta Power Pool Index (C$/MWh)\n\n                    Peak(14)   Peak(16)   Off-Peak       Flat    Change\nfor  16-Oct-01       63.52      60.16      29.14        50.90     11.42\n\n\n\nBPA's Offer in $/MWh\n\nHours     Amount          NW               COB           NOB\n\n\nBPA has no offer until further notice.\n\n\n\nNYMEX Henry Hub Gas Futures in $/mmBtu\n\n                 Close        Change\n        Nov      2.418        -0.174\n        Dec      2.703        -0.149\n\n\n\nNatural Gas Spot Prices in $/mmBtu\n\n                  Low          High\nSumas             2.33         2.38\nSo.

After October 31st, rebates will be reduced to 15?/sf. \n\nOver $21 million in financial incentives are being offered by the CEC for the installation of cool roofs on existing and new buildings. Eligible buildings include: local government, educational, commercial, and multi-family. New residential developments are also eligible; however, existing single-family homes are not.\n\nBy reflecting rather than absorbing solar energy, a cool roof reduces roof temperatures by 50 - 60 ?F compared to a traditional 'hot' roof. As a result, a cool roof lowers a building's cooling energy requirements (by over 20%), increases the life-span of the roof, and reduces peak electricity demand. In addition, since the installed price of cool roofing materials is typically the same as non-reflective materials, the rebate makes cool roofs less expensive than traditional roofs.\n\nThe CEC has partnered with the non-profit Local Government Commission (LGC) to administer the cool roof incentives statewide. To learn more about the program, visit the LGC's web site at: www.lgc.org/techserve/coolroofs/. Or call the Cool Roof Hotline at 1.888.891.COOL(2665).\n\n\nNeutrogena Invests in Solar Energy\n\nSeveral communities and businesses are taking action now to\nreduce carbon emissions, despite the United States government's recent rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on\nClimate Change.  Neutrogena, a division of Johnson & Johnson, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) announced the completion of a 200-kilowat, $1.4 million solar power system at the company's headquarters in Los Angeles.  Neutrogena said a new solar system covering 24,000 square feet of roof area will help reduce the company's energy consumption by about 20 percent monthly.  According to Angelina Galiteva, LADWP director of strategic planning, the Neutrogena system will eliminate more than 513,000 pounds of carbon dioxide annually.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCHEMICAL AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS UPDATE \n\nU.S. Seeks To Stiffen Treaty on Germ War - Pact's Enforcement Mechanism Faulted \n\nPresident Bush continues to oppose a proposed enforcement mechanism for a treaty banning the development or stockpiling of biological weapons but is\npursuing an alternative with new urgency in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, administration officials said yesterday.\n\nThe administration began telling allies this spring that it would not support a proposal to prevent cheating on the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention,\nwhich the United States ratified with 142 other nations. The administration said the verification proposal was fatally flawed, but said the United States\nwanted to find other ways to strengthen the treaty and reduce the chance of germ warfare.\n\nAdministration officials said they plan to present their ideas at a biological weapons conference that begins Nov. 19 in Switzerland. Officials said the\nadministration plans to propose that nations pass stricter laws criminalizing the use and import or export of biological weapons, fund more research into\nillnesses caused by biological weapons, and share information and expertise to minimize the effects if the weapons are used.\n\nFor complete story, go to http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5411-2001Oct16.html\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLOS ANGELES EVENTS WITH PRESIDENT GORBACHEV POSTPONED\n\nFollowing President Gorbachev's decision to cancel his October trip to the U.S., Global Green USA has postponed the Sustainability Symposium and Green Cross Millennium Awards scheduled for October 13.

Officials said the\nadministration plans to propose that nations pass stricter laws criminalizing the use and import or export of biological weapons, fund more research into\nillnesses caused by biological weapons, and share information and expertise to minimize the effects if the weapons are used.\n\nFor complete story, go to http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5411-2001Oct16.html\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLOS ANGELES EVENTS WITH PRESIDENT GORBACHEV POSTPONED\n\nFollowing President Gorbachev's decision to cancel his October trip to the U.S., Global Green USA has postponed the Sustainability Symposium and Green Cross Millennium Awards scheduled for October 13. Mikhail Gorbachev has committed to rescheduling his participation in both events so he can join with us in the celebration at a later time.  We \nwill provide you with a tentative rescheduled date within the next week. \n\nIn the meantime, our collective work must and will continue.  The efforts of \nGlobal Green USA to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and reduce \nenvironmental degradation -- a phenomenon that contributes to the root \ncauses of terrorism, hatred, and fundamentalism -- find new purpose and \nmeaning during this time.\n\nFor more information on the Sustainability Symposium and Millennium Awards, log on to http://www.globalgreen.org or e-mail Laura Grunberger at lgrunberger@globalgreen.org\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow you can support GLOBAL GREEN USA with your online shopping! \n\nGlobal Green USA has teamed up with GreenMarketplace.com to offer you \na smarter and greener shopping experience!

EUCI presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk management.

The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods.

The\nProtocol revision for PIP 144 impacts sections 4.4.4 and 6.3.1 of the\nProtocols.  The revision for PIP 200 is documented in section 11.4.1.1\nof the protocols.\n\nCurrently, ERCOT calculates ancillary service obligations for each QSE\nfor a given trade day based on the QSE???s aggregated Load Ratio Share as\nof the same day of the prior week.  This results in the use of QSE/LSE\nrelationships from one week prior to calculate ancillary service\nobligations.  When an LSE switches from one QSE to another, the\nobligation associated with its load continue to be allocated to the old\nQSE for one week after the effective date of the switch.  The same\nobligation does not get allocated to the new QSE for the first week\nafter the switch.  QSEs also do not have access to Load Ratio Share data\nper LSE that makes up their ancillary service obligations.\n\nThis modification will alter the way the QSE Load Ratio Shares are\naggregated so that ancillary service obligations are calculated based on\nthe QSE/LSE relationships that will be effective on the trade day for\nwhich obligations are being posted.  Load Ratio Shares will be\ncalculated and saved by LSE during the data aggregation process run for\ninitial settlement of the trade day in question.  QSE Load Ratio Share\nwill then be aggregated and posted for a given trade day based on the\nsum of LSE Load Ratio Shares calculated as described above corresponding\nto the most current QSE/LSE relationships for that trade day.\n\nScheduled Extract Changes:  Billing determinants for LSE Load Ratio\nShares called LRSLSE will be added to the load extract.  Each QSE will\nhave the LRSLSE fields added to its load extract for each LSE it\nrepresents.  Each LSE will also have the LRSLSE field added to its load\nextract with its Load Ratio Share information.   \n\nDynamic Extract:  The Settlement and Billing folder within the archive\nextracts area of the portal will have an additional dynamic extract\nfolder added called ???Obligations???.  This dynamic extract folder will\nhave two extracts called ???QSE obligations??? and ???LSE obligations??? which\ncan be used to query Load Ratio Shares by QSE and LSE.  The following\nERCOT total quantities will also be added to the dynamic extracts above:\n\n??        Total obligated non-spinning quantity (NSOTOT)\n\n??        Total obligated regulation down quantity (RDOTOT)\n\n??        Total obligated responsive reserve quantity (RROTOT)\n\n??        Total obligated regulation up quantity (RUOTOT) \n\n \n\nYou can find details of PRR-294 at the following link:\nhttp://www.ercot.com/AboutERCOT/PublicDisclosure/ProtocolRev.htm .\n\nIf you have any questions, please call your ERCOT client service\nrepresentative.

EUCI presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).\n\n \n\nThe brochure for the Electricity Risk Management 101 Workshop and the Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference can be obtained by clicking on the link below:\n\nhttp://www.euci.com/pdf/risk_mgmt.pdf\n\n \n\nTransmission Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference\n\nFeb. 5-8, 2002, Miami, Florida\n\n \n\nOVERVIEW\n\n \n\nThis conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO initiatives.  The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods.

The conference will emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing process.  The processes of Asset management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link short term issues of the trading & marketing departments. The purpose is to show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset owner.\n\n \n\nThe brochure for the Power Generation Asset and Portfolio Management Conference, March 26-28, 2002, Wyndham Hotel Downtown, Atlanta, GA can be obtained by clicking on the link below:\n\n \n\nhttp://www.euci.com/pdf/powergeneration.pdf\n\n \n\nPlease print the brochure and fax the registration form back to us at 303-741-0849 if you would like to attend any of these events.

The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).\n\n \n\nThe brochure for the Electricity Risk Management 101 Workshop and the Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference can be obtained by clicking on the link below:\n\nhttp://www.euci.com/pdf/risk_mgmt.pdf\n\n \n\nTransmission Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference\n\nFeb. 5-8, 2002, Miami, Florida\n\n \n\nOVERVIEW\n\n \n\nThis conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO initiatives.  The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.\n\n \n\nThe brochure for the Conference and associated Workshops can be obtained by clicking on the link below:\n\nhttp://www.euci.com/pdf/trans_expn.pdf\n\n \n\nElectricity Market Design Conference\n\nMarch 25-26, 2002, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n \n\nOVERVIEW\n\n \n\nThis Conference will focus on how to design competitive electricity markets that maximize the benefits to consumers while at the same time maintaining the financial viability of companies participating in these markets.\n\n \n\nThe brochure for the Electricity Market Design Conference, March 25-26, 2002, Wyndham Hotel Downtown, Atlanta, GA can be obtained by clicking on the link below:\n\n \n\nhttp://www.euci.com/pdf/mktdesign.pdf\n\n \n\nPower Generation Asset and Portfolio Management Conference\n\nMarch 26-28 2002, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n \n\nOVERVIEW\n\n \n\nThis conference will highlight the commonalties and common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the enterprise.  The conference will emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing process.  The processes of Asset management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link short term issues of the trading & marketing departments. The purpose is to show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset owner.\n\n \n\nThe brochure for the Power Generation Asset and Portfolio Management Conference, March 26-28, 2002, Wyndham Hotel Downtown, Atlanta, GA can be obtained by clicking on the link below:\n\n \n\nhttp://www.euci.com/pdf/powergeneration.pdf\n\n \n\nPlease print the brochure and fax the registration form back to us at 303-741-0849 if you would like to attend any of these events.

The \"revenue\" position that is created when the contract is signed with the customer will be settled based on the published PJM Zone LMP, nevertheless the commodity desk may choose to manage their \"cost\" otherwise.

The new program will focus on fuel cells and\nhydrogen production from renewable energy sources. DOE\nwill carry out the freedomCAR program in partnership with\nthe U.S. Council of Automotive Research -- a cooperative\nresearch organization formed by Ford Motor Company,\nGeneral Motors Corporation, and DaimlerChrysler\nCorporation. In fact, the \"CAR\" in \"freedomCAR\" stands for\n\"Cooperative Automotive Research.\"\n\nFreedomCAR replaces the Clinton-era \"Partnership for a\nNew Generation of Vehicles\" (PNGV), which aimed to\nproduce an affordable sedan that achieves 80 miles per\ngallon by 2004. In contrast, the long-term goal for\nfreedomCAR is to develop technologies for hydrogen-\npowered fuel cell vehicles that will require no foreign oil and\nemit no harmful pollutants or greenhouse gases. An\ninteresting aspect of freedomCAR is its emphasis on\ndeveloping a hydrogen supply infrastructure: many\nautomotive companies are currently developing cars that\nwould be fueled with low-sulfur gasoline, methanol, or\nnatural gas fuels, which would be converted to hydrogen\nusing onboard fuel processors. FreedomCAR looks farther\nahead to an energy economy that is built around hydrogen\nas the energy carrier.\n\nSee the DOE press release, with a link to a fact sheet, at:\n<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases02/janpr/pr02001.htm>.\n\nSo how do you produce hydrogen? Today, most hydrogen is\nproduced from fossil fuels. It can also be produced by\npassing a current through two electrodes immersed in water,\nbut that technique tends to be expensive. Researchers are\nnow examining ways to make hydrogen from organic\nmaterials, to generate it from organic processes, or to\nproduce it directly from sunlight and water. Some catalysts\nhelp sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, but\nresearchers are also using modified solar cells immersed in\nwater, called photoelectrodes. For more information, see the\nHydrogen Information Network on EREN at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/hydrogen/>.\n\nFor those more technically inclined, the proceedings of the\n2001 DOE Hydrogen Program Review are posted on the\nHydrogen Information Network at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/hydrogen/docs/30535toc.html>.\n\n\nFord Shows Hybrid Escape SUV at Detroit Auto Show\n\nFord Motor Company is displaying the hybrid electric version\nof its Escape sport utility vehicle (SUV) at the North\nAmerican International Auto Show, now underway in Detroit.\nFord confirmed that the vehicle will be available in 2003, and\nannounced that its emissions will be low enough to qualify as\na Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (PZEV) under California\nlaw. The vehicle is expected to achieve nearly 40 miles to\nthe gallon. See the Ford Hybrid Electric Vehicle Web site at:\n<http://www.hybridford.com/index.asp>.\n\nWhile domestic auto companies continue to prepare their\nhybrid-electric vehicles for production, U.S. sales of the\nToyota Prius and the Honda Insight continue to grow. Toyota\nMotor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. announced that it sold 15,556\nPriuses in the United States in 2001, up from 5,562 in 2000\n(U.S. sales of the Prius began in mid-2000). American\nHonda announced Insight sales of 4,726 in 2001, up from\n3,788 in 2000.\n\nSee the Toyota press release, \"Toyota Sets Sales Record\nfor Sixth Year in a Row,\" on the Toyota Pressroom Web site\nat: <http://pressroom.toyota.com/>.\n\nSee the American Honda press release at:\n<http://www.hondacars.com/news/press.html?y=2002&r=770>.\n\nThe Honda Civic Hybrid, unveiled in Japan last month, had\nits U.S. debut in Los Angeles early this month. Honda claims\nthe Civic Hybrid will achieve about 50 miles per gallon and\nwill cost about $20,000. Honda expects to sell 2,000 vehicles\nper month when it goes on sale in the United States in April.\nSee the American Honda press release at:\n<http://www.hondacars.com/news/press.html?y=2002&r=774>.\n\n\nWind Capacity Surges Ahead in the U.S. and the World\n\nU.S. wind power capacity increased by 66 percent in 2001,\naccording to figures released yesterday by the American\nWind Energy Association (AWEA). The record growth of\n1,694 megawatts boosted the total U.S. wind power capacity\nfrom 2,564 megawatts to 4,258 megawatts. AWEA says last\nyear's installations represent capital investments of about\n$1.7 billion and will produce enough electricity to meet the\nannual needs of 475,000 U.S. households. See the January\n15th press release on the AWEA Web site at:\n<http://www.awea.org/news/index.html>.\n\nThe U.S. growth in wind capacity is actually outpacing the\nworld growth: according to the Earth Policy Institute, world\nwind power capacity increased 31 percent in 2001. In fact,\nwind capacity grew faster in the United States than in the\nother four leading wind-development countries: Germany,\nDenmark, India and Spain. Germany, however, still has\nnearly twice the wind power capacity as the United States,\nthanks to aggressive government policies for wind power\ndevelopment. German wind power capacity overtook\nU.S. wind power capacity in 1997. According to the Earth\nPolicy Institute, the world's total wind power capacity is now\nat 23,300 megawatts -- more than five times the U.S. capacity.\nSee the Earth Policy press release, with links to detailed\ntables and graphs, at:\n<http://www.earth-policy.org/Updates/Update5.htm>.\n\n(Note that the Earth Policy numbers are preliminary, so they\nare slightly lower than the AWEA numbers.)\n\nIf the latest news is any indication, world wind power\ncapacity will continue to grow rapidly in 2002. Ireland gave\nthe go-ahead for the world's largest offshore wind power\nfacility last week. Ireland's Minister for the Marine and\nNatural Resources approved a wind power lease of the\nArklow Bank, a sand bank located more than four miles off\nthe coast of Ireland. Eirtricity, Ireland's largest renewable\nenergy developer, intends to build a 520-megawatt wind\nplant along the sand bank, beginning with 60 megawatts in\n2002 and completing the site by 2005. See the eirtricity Web\nsite at: <http://www.eirtricity.ie/news-11-01-2002.htm>.\n\n\nWind Turbine Installed on Novel Tower Without Large Crane\n\nA single 660-kilowatt wind turbine was installed in December\nin Omaha, Nebraska, to serve a green power program run\nby the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD). The installation\nuses an innovative tower designed by Valmont Industries Inc.\nthat incorporates a lifting platform for installing the turbine.\nThe platform eliminated the need for a large crane to install\nthe turbine. See the OPPD Web site at:\n<http://www.oppd.com/news/GreenPower.htm>.\n\nValmont Industries believes its wind turbine tower could help\nexpand the installation of wind turbines into rugged terrains\nthat present access problems for large cranes. See the\nValmont Web site at:\n<http://www.valmont.com/poles/poles7.shtml>.\n\n\nNorth Carolina Utilities to Pursue Green Power\n\nA Green Power Program Advisory Committee formed last\nyear in North Carolina has led the electric utility companies\nthroughout the state to pursue a green power program.\nAccording to Advanced Energy, which helped form the\nadvisory committee, the three investor-owned utilities in\nNorth Carolina have publicly declared their intentions to file\nfor a green power program with the state's utility commission.\nThe state's municipal utilities and electric cooperatives have\nalso agreed to participate. A statewide program should be in\nplace by mid-year. Advanced Energy is a non-profit energy\nconsultancy founded by the North Carolina Utilities Commission\nin 1980. See the Advanced Energy Web site at:\n<http://www.advancedenergy.org/greenpower/index.html>.\n\nGreen power also continues to advance in Washington\nstate, where all the utilities are now required by law to offer a\ngreen power program. The latest offerings come from Avista\nUtilities, which serves nearly 310,000 electric customers in\neastern Washington and northern Idaho, and from Clark\nPublic Utilities in southwest Washington. Clark Public\nUtilities is buying so-called \"green tags\" from the Bonneville\nEnvironmental Foundation, while Avista is buying wind\npower from the Stateline Wind Project that went online at\nyear end.\n\nSee the Avista Web site at:\n<http://www.avistautilities.com/account/windpower.asp>.\n\nAnd see the January 7th press release from Clark Public\nUtilities by selecting \"News Releases\" on the Web site at:\n<http://www.clarkpublicutilities.com/events.html>.\n\nUtah Power's \"Blue Sky\" green power program is also\ngaining ground -- Salt Lake City's Uinta Brewing Company\nopened its new brewery last week with the announcement\nthat it will buy 100 percent renewable energy to power the\nfacility. The brewery expects to purchase more than a\nquarter million kilowatt-hours of wind power per year. See\nthe announcement on the Utah Green Power Web site at:\n<http://www.utahgreenpower.org/News.htm#uinta>.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is\nencouraging more companies to buy green power through its\nGreen Power Partnership Program. Companies that commit\nto buying green power will gain technical support and public\nrecognition from EPA by joining the partnership. See the\nnewly revised Green Power Partnership Program Web site\nat: <http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/>.\n\n\nNew York Power Authority Buys Eight 200-Kilowatt Fuel Cells\n\nUTC Fuel Cells announced last month the sale of eight fuel\ncell systems to the New York Power Authority (NYPA), which\nwill use them at four wastewater treatment facilities in New\nYork City. NYPA will use waste gas (primarily methane) from\nthe water treatment process to power the fuel cells. Each of\nthe units generates 200 kilowatts of electricity. See the\nUTC Fuel Cells press release at:\n<http://www.utcfuelcells.com/news/archive/121901.shtml>.\n\nOther recent fuel cell developments include the installation of\na Nuvera Fuel Cell at a Verizon telecommunications site in\nMassachusetts and the shipment of a 5-kilowatt fuel cell --\nproduced by DCH Technologies, Inc. -- to the Houston\nAdvanced Research Center (HARC).\n\nSee the December 18th press release on the Nuvera Web\nsite at: <http://www.nuvera.com/>.\n\nSee also the HARC press release at:\n<http://www.harc.edu/pressroom/02_0103.html>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nENERGY FACTS AND TIPS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nU.S. Energy Companies Expanded Oil, Gas Reserves in 2000\n\nThe major U.S. energy companies achieved great success\nwith their drill bits in 2000, significantly boosting oil and gas\nreserves, according to a report released last week by DOE's\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA). The major U.S.\nenergy producers expanded their worldwide oil and gas\nreserves by an equivalent of 6.6 billion barrels of crude oil in\n2000, exceeding their worldwide oil and gas production by\n22 percent, allowing the reserves to gain some ground over\nproduction.\n\nMeanwhile, the companies actually gained 60 percent of\ntheir oil and gas reserve increases through mergers and\nacquisitions. The companies nearly doubled their worldwide\ncapital expenditures in 2000, and most of the growth in\nspending went toward mergers and acquisitions. The\ncompanies also posted record profits, as their net income\nincreased 133 percent from 1999 levels to a new record of\n$53.2 billion.

AWEA says last\nyear's installations represent capital investments of about\n$1.7 billion and will produce enough electricity to meet the\nannual needs of 475,000 U.S. households. See the January\n15th press release on the AWEA Web site at:\n<http://www.awea.org/news/index.html>.\n\nThe U.S. growth in wind capacity is actually outpacing the\nworld growth: according to the Earth Policy Institute, world\nwind power capacity increased 31 percent in 2001. In fact,\nwind capacity grew faster in the United States than in the\nother four leading wind-development countries: Germany,\nDenmark, India and Spain. Germany, however, still has\nnearly twice the wind power capacity as the United States,\nthanks to aggressive government policies for wind power\ndevelopment. German wind power capacity overtook\nU.S. wind power capacity in 1997. According to the Earth\nPolicy Institute, the world's total wind power capacity is now\nat 23,300 megawatts -- more than five times the U.S. capacity.\nSee the Earth Policy press release, with links to detailed\ntables and graphs, at:\n<http://www.earth-policy.org/Updates/Update5.htm>.\n\n(Note that the Earth Policy numbers are preliminary, so they\nare slightly lower than the AWEA numbers.)\n\nIf the latest news is any indication, world wind power\ncapacity will continue to grow rapidly in 2002. Ireland gave\nthe go-ahead for the world's largest offshore wind power\nfacility last week. Ireland's Minister for the Marine and\nNatural Resources approved a wind power lease of the\nArklow Bank, a sand bank located more than four miles off\nthe coast of Ireland. Eirtricity, Ireland's largest renewable\nenergy developer, intends to build a 520-megawatt wind\nplant along the sand bank, beginning with 60 megawatts in\n2002 and completing the site by 2005. See the eirtricity Web\nsite at: <http://www.eirtricity.ie/news-11-01-2002.htm>.\n\n\nWind Turbine Installed on Novel Tower Without Large Crane\n\nA single 660-kilowatt wind turbine was installed in December\nin Omaha, Nebraska, to serve a green power program run\nby the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD). The installation\nuses an innovative tower designed by Valmont Industries Inc.\nthat incorporates a lifting platform for installing the turbine.\nThe platform eliminated the need for a large crane to install\nthe turbine. See the OPPD Web site at:\n<http://www.oppd.com/news/GreenPower.htm>.\n\nValmont Industries believes its wind turbine tower could help\nexpand the installation of wind turbines into rugged terrains\nthat present access problems for large cranes. See the\nValmont Web site at:\n<http://www.valmont.com/poles/poles7.shtml>.\n\n\nNorth Carolina Utilities to Pursue Green Power\n\nA Green Power Program Advisory Committee formed last\nyear in North Carolina has led the electric utility companies\nthroughout the state to pursue a green power program.\nAccording to Advanced Energy, which helped form the\nadvisory committee, the three investor-owned utilities in\nNorth Carolina have publicly declared their intentions to file\nfor a green power program with the state's utility commission.\nThe state's municipal utilities and electric cooperatives have\nalso agreed to participate. A statewide program should be in\nplace by mid-year. Advanced Energy is a non-profit energy\nconsultancy founded by the North Carolina Utilities Commission\nin 1980. See the Advanced Energy Web site at:\n<http://www.advancedenergy.org/greenpower/index.html>.\n\nGreen power also continues to advance in Washington\nstate, where all the utilities are now required by law to offer a\ngreen power program. The latest offerings come from Avista\nUtilities, which serves nearly 310,000 electric customers in\neastern Washington and northern Idaho, and from Clark\nPublic Utilities in southwest Washington. Clark Public\nUtilities is buying so-called \"green tags\" from the Bonneville\nEnvironmental Foundation, while Avista is buying wind\npower from the Stateline Wind Project that went online at\nyear end.\n\nSee the Avista Web site at:\n<http://www.avistautilities.com/account/windpower.asp>.\n\nAnd see the January 7th press release from Clark Public\nUtilities by selecting \"News Releases\" on the Web site at:\n<http://www.clarkpublicutilities.com/events.html>.\n\nUtah Power's \"Blue Sky\" green power program is also\ngaining ground -- Salt Lake City's Uinta Brewing Company\nopened its new brewery last week with the announcement\nthat it will buy 100 percent renewable energy to power the\nfacility. The brewery expects to purchase more than a\nquarter million kilowatt-hours of wind power per year. See\nthe announcement on the Utah Green Power Web site at:\n<http://www.utahgreenpower.org/News.htm#uinta>.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is\nencouraging more companies to buy green power through its\nGreen Power Partnership Program. Companies that commit\nto buying green power will gain technical support and public\nrecognition from EPA by joining the partnership. See the\nnewly revised Green Power Partnership Program Web site\nat: <http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/>.\n\n\nNew York Power Authority Buys Eight 200-Kilowatt Fuel Cells\n\nUTC Fuel Cells announced last month the sale of eight fuel\ncell systems to the New York Power Authority (NYPA), which\nwill use them at four wastewater treatment facilities in New\nYork City. NYPA will use waste gas (primarily methane) from\nthe water treatment process to power the fuel cells. Each of\nthe units generates 200 kilowatts of electricity. See the\nUTC Fuel Cells press release at:\n<http://www.utcfuelcells.com/news/archive/121901.shtml>.\n\nOther recent fuel cell developments include the installation of\na Nuvera Fuel Cell at a Verizon telecommunications site in\nMassachusetts and the shipment of a 5-kilowatt fuel cell --\nproduced by DCH Technologies, Inc. -- to the Houston\nAdvanced Research Center (HARC).\n\nSee the December 18th press release on the Nuvera Web\nsite at: <http://www.nuvera.com/>.\n\nSee also the HARC press release at:\n<http://www.harc.edu/pressroom/02_0103.html>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nENERGY FACTS AND TIPS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nU.S. Energy Companies Expanded Oil, Gas Reserves in 2000\n\nThe major U.S. energy companies achieved great success\nwith their drill bits in 2000, significantly boosting oil and gas\nreserves, according to a report released last week by DOE's\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA). The major U.S.\nenergy producers expanded their worldwide oil and gas\nreserves by an equivalent of 6.6 billion barrels of crude oil in\n2000, exceeding their worldwide oil and gas production by\n22 percent, allowing the reserves to gain some ground over\nproduction.\n\nMeanwhile, the companies actually gained 60 percent of\ntheir oil and gas reserve increases through mergers and\nacquisitions. The companies nearly doubled their worldwide\ncapital expenditures in 2000, and most of the growth in\nspending went toward mergers and acquisitions. The\ncompanies also posted record profits, as their net income\nincreased 133 percent from 1999 levels to a new record of\n$53.2 billion. See the EIA press release, with a link to the full\nreport, at: <http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/press/press188.html>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nABOUT THIS NEWSLETTER\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can subscribe to this newsletter using the online form at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/subscribe/>.\nThis Web page also allows you to update your email address\nor unsubscribe to this newsletter.\n\nThe Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Network (EREN)\nhome page is located at <http://www.eren.doe.gov/>.\n\nIf you have questions or comments about this\nnewsletter, please contact the editor, Kevin Eber, at\nkevin_eber@nrel.gov.","messageId":"<20444336.1075861007982.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2002-01-16T05:30:10+05:30","from":"keber@mail.nrel.gov","subject":"EREN Network News -- 01/16/02","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"EREN <keber@mail.nrel.gov>","xTo":"eren@mail.nrel.gov","xFolder":"\\Richard_Ring_Mar2002\\Ring, Richard\\Deleted Items","xOrigin":"Ring-R","xFileName":"rring (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"eren@mail.nrel.gov"}

{"rawContent":"\n\nGLOBAL GREEN USA AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS JOINTLY RELEASE BASELINE STUDY OF BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECOVERY PROGRAMS\n\nFor Immediate Release -\n\nATLANTA, January 16, 2002 - A unique coalition of industry, governmental agencies and environmental organizations has released a study that, for the first time, provides baseline statistics on the costs, benefits and effectiveness of programs to recover discarded beverage containers for recycling. Understanding Beverage Container Recycling: A Value Chain Assessment is the final report of the Multi-Stakeholder Recovery Project, Stage One. Businesses and Environmentalists Allied for Recycling (BEAR), a project of Global Green USA, launched the initiative last Spring in an effort to bring together long-standing opponents in the battle over different approaches to recycling in a fact-based approach to public policy making. Project participants included The Coca-Cola Company, Waste Management, Inc., Beaulieu of America, Tomra North America, Southeastern Container, GrassRoots Recycling Network and the Container Recycling Institute.  The report was prepared by a research consulting!\n team comprising R.W. Beck, Inc., Franklin Associates, Ltd., the Tellus Institute and Sound Resource Management Group.  Research was coordinated by the project manager, Boisson & Associates. \n\nWorking intensively over six months, project participants made progress towards their objective of identifying jointly supported policies by participating in a study of existing U.S. recovery programs.  'We made a good start by showing that groups with divergent views can work together and reach substantial agreement,' said Ben Jordan, Environmental Manager for The Coca-Cola Company. 'We didn't agree to recommend any particular program, but we established a model for overcoming the historical entrenchment that has stymied progress for two decades,' according to Rick Best, Board Member of GrassRoots Recycling Network. \n\nThe report is a snapshot of U.S. programs as they operated in 1999, and does not attempt to project how programs would perform if they were to be expanded or replicated in other areas.  The report contrasts the effectiveness of different programs in detail, and verifies that deposit systems recover the highest percentage of discarded containers, followed by municipal curbside programs and residential drop-off programs. 'But the cost of recovery programs is more subtle than advocates on either side have been willing to admit,' said Pierre Ferrari, BEAR's Chair. The findings indicate some ways that the costs of deposit and other recycling programs can be reduced. But participants stressed that the report does not attempt to address important implementation questions regarding new or expanded recycling systems.  The report also shows the environmental advantages of recycling containers.  'We documented several key benefits in this collaborative process, for example, beverage co!\nntainer recycling saved about 147 trillion BTU in 1999, that's equivalent to over 32 million barrels of oil,' said Matt Petersen, President and CEO of Global Green USA. \n\nProject participants agreed that there is a need to continue fact-based, collaborative discussions and will invite additional stakeholders to participate.  'The Multi-Stakeholder Recovery Project is a critical component of the movement to secure voluntary, long-term product stewardship agreements in the U.S.,' according to Sherry Enzler, Director of the Minnesota Office of Environmental Assistance. Future efforts are likely to concentrate on addressing stakeholder concerns about different policies. One key issue is the need for aggressive market development initiatives to minimize potential market volatility associated with increasing recovery. \n\nBusinesses and Environmentalists Allied for Recycling, a project of Global Green USA, is a coalition dedicated to increasing the national recycling rate for used beverage containers to 80%.  Its members are united by agreement on principles including: minimizing environmental impacts while improving all packaging, creating sustainable jobs and businesses, and working with clarity and honesty to understand costs and evaluate the widest range of policies and practices to achieve its goal.   Global Green USA -- created in 1994 as the U.S. affiliate of Mikhail Gorbachev's environmental movement Green Cross International  -- works in cooperation with individuals, industry, and government to foster a global value shift toward a sustainable and secure world.

The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods.

{"rawContent":"\nTransmission Expansion and Systems in Transition  Conference\n\nFeb. 5-8, 2002, Miami, Florida\n\n \n\nOVERVIEW\n\n \n\nThis conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO initiatives.  The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.\n\n \n\nThe brochure for the Conference and associated Workshops can be obtained by clicking on the link below:\n\nhttp://www.euci.com/pdf/trans_expn.pdf\n\n \n\nElectricity Market Design Conference\n\n \n\nMarch 25-26, 2002, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n \n\nOVERVIEW\n\n \n\nThis Conference will focus on how to design competitive electricity markets that maximize the benefits to consumers while at the same time maintaining the financial viability of companies participating in these markets.\n\n \n\nThe brochure for the Electricity Market Design Conference, March 25-26, 2002, Wyndham Hotel Downtown, Atlanta, GA can be obtained by clicking on the link below:\n\nhttp://www.euci.com/pdf/MrktDesgn.pdf\n\n \n\nPower Generation Asset and Portfolio Management Conference\n\n \n\nMarch 26-28 2002, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n \n\nOVERVIEW\n\n \n\nThis conference will highlight the commonalties and common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the enterprise.

Let's move on. Next question.\"\n\nMr Lay told the conference call that Enron, which has been asked to provide information to the Securities and Exchange Commission over transactions, would not be downgraded to below investment grade.\n\n\"We don't think there is any chance of that. I re-emphasise we are committed to maintaining our ratings,\" he said. \n\n\nMr Lay also said he was very concerned that Mr Fastow's character and the company's integrity had been \"loosely thrown about\" in recent days.\n\nEnron held the conference call to address \"investor concerns\" after it announced the SEC had requested it voluntarily provide information \"regarding certain related party transactions\". It is understood that there were only 300 lines into the conferenc call and these were tied up early making it difficult to access.\n\nThe call followed a rapid sell-down in the stock, in reaction to Enron's surprise revelation last week of a $1.2bn charge to equity to eliminate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing vehicles. \n\nIn releasing the SEC call for more detailed information, Enron hopes to counter growing criticism that it should be more transparent. \"We welcome this request,\" said Mr Lay. \"We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest.\" \n\nThe SEC probe into Enron's financial dealings is an informal one at this stage, according to the company, and the request for documents is voluntary. However, SEC probes often begin lightly as investigators gather information on an issue. \n\nSuch probes, including the one the currently involves Enron, could turn into a formal investigation at any time.

Let's move on. Next question.\"\n\nMr Lay told the conference call that Enron, which has been asked to provide information to the Securities and Exchange Commission over transactions, would not be downgraded to below investment grade.\n\n\"We don't think there is any chance of that. I re-emphasise we are committed to maintaining our ratings,\" he said. \n\n\nMr Lay also said he was very concerned that Mr Fastow's character and the company's integrity had been \"loosely thrown about\" in recent days.\n\nEnron held the conference call to address \"investor concerns\" after it announced the SEC had requested it voluntarily provide information \"regarding certain related party transactions\". It is understood that there were only 300 lines into the conferenc call and these were tied up early making it difficult to access.\n\nThe call followed a rapid sell-down in the stock, in reaction to Enron's surprise revelation last week of a $1.2bn charge to equity to eliminate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing vehicles. \n\nIn releasing the SEC call for more detailed information, Enron hopes to counter growing criticism that it should be more transparent. \"We welcome this request,\" said Mr Lay. \"We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest.\" \n\nThe SEC probe into Enron's financial dealings is an informal one at this stage, according to the company, and the request for documents is voluntary. However, SEC probes often begin lightly as investigators gather information on an issue. \n\nSuch probes, including the one the currently involves Enron, could turn into a formal investigation at any time. Should that happen, regulators would be armed with subpoena power and could demand certain documents be handed over. The SEC would not confirm or deny the existence of the Enron probe. \n\nMr Lay did not detail which transactions the SEC was reviewing, though analysts believe they relate to Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, who has been reported to have, until recently, run a limited partnership that bought assets valued at hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron. \n\nAnalysts say the transactions themselves, while controversial because of Mr Fastow's links to the company, have been disclosed repeatedly.

Those\nnumbers are adjusted for economic growth and differences in\nweather, but the cold, raw numbers still show a 4.4 percent\ndrop in electricity use and a 5.4 percent drop in peak demand.\nGovernor Gray Davis lauded Californians for their achievement.\nSee the statistics, with a link to a January 17th press release\nfrom Governor Davis, at:\n<http://www.energy.ca.gov/electricity/peak_demand_reduction.html>.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest can be proud, too, according to DOE's\nBonneville Power Administration (BPA): the region reduced its\nelectricity demand by roughly 85 megawatts, or enough to\npower more than 80,000 homes, in 2001. See the BPA press\nrelease at: <http://www.bpa.gov/Corporate/KCC/nr/02nr/nr011702.shtml>.\n\n\nSpire Solar Chicago Installs 100 Kilowatts of Solar Power\n\nSpire Solar Chicago, a business unit of Spire Corporation,\nannounced last week the installation of a total of 100 kilowatts\nof solar photovoltaic systems on six roofs in Chicago. The\nsystems were installed on the DuSable Museum of African\nAmerican History, the Homan Square Community Center,\nCommonwealth Edison's South Hydome facility, two Chicago\npublic schools, and a small commercial building. The\ninstallations are part of a local public/private partnership to\nproduce clean energy in Chicago. See the Spire press release\nat: <http://www.spirecorp.com/Spire/news/PV369.html>.\n\n\nDOT Proposes No Change in Light Truck Efficiency Standards\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nNHTSA), a part of the U.S. Department of Transportation\n(DOT), released last week its proposed fuel efficiency\nstandards for Model Year 2004 light trucks. The proposed\nstandard holds the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency\n(CAFE) standard for light trucks at its current level of\n20.7 miles per gallon. The light truck classification includes\nvans, pickup trucks, and most sport utility vehicles (SUVs).\n\nSince 1996, Congress has prohibited NHTSA from spending\nany funds to consider changes to the CAFE standards.\nAlthough that prohibition was lifted in December, the NHTSA\nclaims it has not had sufficient time to consider changes to\nthe standard. The NHTSA must issue its proposed rules\nearly enough to allow public comment and changes prior to a\nfinal rulemaking, which must be issued by April 1st. The\npublic is invited to provide comments on the proposed fuel\nefficiency standard before mid-February. See the January 18th\npress release on the NHTSA Web site at:\n<http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/nhtsa/announce/press/index.cfm>.\n\nOn January 14th, four days before the proposed standards\nwere released, the National Research Council (NRC) sent\nNHTSA a report confirming the NRC's conclusions on CAFE\nstandards, originally released in a detailed report published\nin July 2001. The reassessment was performed after the\ninitial report was challenged by the automotive industry. The\nlatest report reaffirms that \"technologies exist that, if applied\nto passenger cars and light-duty trucks, would significantly\nreduce fuel consumption within 15 years,\" and that\n\"assessment of currently offered product technologies\nsuggest that light-duty trucks, including SUVs, pickups, and\nminivans, offer the greatest potential to reduce fuel\nconsumption...\" See the new report on the National\nAcademy Press Web site at:\n<http://books.nap.edu/books/NI000377/html/R1.html>.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA), the overall fuel economy of light vehicles -- including\nboth light trucks and cars -- is now at a 21-year low of\n20.4 miles per gallon. Although car mileage has remained\nessentially flat for the past 16 years and light truck mileage\nhas stayed largely unchanged for the past 20 years, the\ngrowing market share of light trucks has dragged down the\noverall fuel economy of light vehicles. See the EPA \"Light\nDuty Automotive Technology and Fuel Economy Trends\"\nWeb page at: <http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fetrends.htm>.\n\nNote that actual fuel economies can be lower than the CAFE\nstandards for a number of reasons, including the fact that\nmanufacturers earn credits for any alternative-fuel vehicles\nthat they sell. Some manufacturers also fall below the\nstandards and pay penalties. To see how the details of how\nmanufacturers are meeting the standards, see the NHTSA\nreport on Model Year 2000 CAFE standards at:\n<http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/studies/fuelecon/index.html>.\n\n\nReal-World Test of Superconductor Cable Delayed\n\nA test of a high-temperature superconductor (HTS) cable at\na Detroit Edison substation has been delayed indefinitely.\nAccording to American Superconductor Corporation, which\nmade the HTS wires for the cables, a problem with the\nvacuum insulating system used to help keep the cables cool\nis preventing Detroit Edison from placing the HTS cables into\nservice. The company says the HTS wires met all their\nperformance requirements, and the vacuum insulating\ntechnology is a proven technology that would not be\nexpected to hinder the future use of HTS cables. Pirelli\nEnergy Cables and Systems, the cable manufacturer, is\nexpected to issue a revised timetable for the demonstration\nproject in spring.\n\nThe Detroit Edison substation is the site of the first\ninstallation and demonstration of an underground HTS cable\nin a U.S. utility network. The utility installed three 400-foot\ncables inside 4-inch-diameter underground ducts during the\nsummer of 2001. All other cable components, including the\ncryogenic cooling and vacuum insulating systems, were\ncompleted in the fall.\n\nAmerican Superconductor does have some good news,\nthough: its 5,000-horsepower HTS motor prototype, which\nuses HTS wires in its rotor winding (the part of the motor that\nrotates), was successfully tested at full load early this month.\nThe motor also successfully carried a peak load of 7,000\nhorsepower while running at its rated speed. Both the HTS\nrotor coils and the refrigeration system met or exceeded their\nperformance goals, and the system as a whole operated at\nan efficiency of 97.2 percent. The company claims it also\nidentified potential changes to the stator (the part of the\nmotor that stays still, or static) that could boost the efficiency\nof the motor to 97.7 percent. See the American Superconductor\npress releases at: <http://www.amsuper.com/press.htm>.\n\n\nReport Questions Government Support for Renewable Energy\n\nA report issued early this month by the Cato Institute, a\nnon-profit public policy research foundation, says that\ngovernment subsidies for renewable energy sources are\nunwarranted. The report says that renewable energy is not\nlikely to gain significant market share in the foreseeable\nfuture without a significant increase in government subsidies\nor mandates. The report also claims that the environmental\nbenefits of renewable energy could be achieved more\ncheaply using other technologies.\n\nThe report does acknowledge that government subsidies for\nfully commercialized fossil energy technologies -- oil, coal,\nand natural gas -- are nearly double those for renewable\nenergy, while nuclear and fossil fuels are also receiving\nmore research and development funds. It also suggests that\nnatural gas prices and availability will remain stable for the\nforeseeable future. See the Cato Institute press release, with\na link to the full report, at:\n<http://www.cato.org/new/01-02/01-08-02r-2.html>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nENERGY FACTS AND TIPS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nReport Claims Utilities are Struggling to Power Data Centers\n\nA report issued last week suggests that electric utilities are\nhaving a difficult time providing power to electronic data\ncenters, including so-called \"Internet hotels\" that provide\nservers for Web sites. The Platts report finds that such data\ncenters can consume from 8 to 50 times the electricity per\nsquare foot used by standard commercial buildings. For\ninstance, a 344,000-square-foot data center under\nconstruction in Washington State is expected to draw up to\n105 megawatts of power when it is complete. Such high\npower loads are causing some data centers to develop their\nown power sources. See the news release from Platts, one\nof The McGraw-Hill Companies, at:\n<http://www.platts.com/pressreleases/pressrelease2002-0118.shtml>.\n\nThe Platts report might be somewhat suspect, however, in\nlight of a report issued last summer by DOE's Lawrence\nBerkeley Laboratory (LBL). That report found that, for a\nvariety of reasons, data centers often greatly exaggerate\ntheir power needs. It concluded that data centers use at\nmost 50 watts per square foot, and usually closer to 40 watts\nper square foot. This number applies only to the computer\nroom part of the facility, and not surrounding office areas.\nUsing these figures, the data center in Washington would\nneed at most 17.2 megawatts of power -- probably much\nless. See the August 29th edition of EREN Network News at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2001/aug29_01.html>.\n\nA report released last month by the Renewable Energy\nPolicy Project (REPP) suggests that energy use in data\ncenters could be even lower. Using efficient servers,\nproperly sized and efficient cooling systems, and other\nenergy efficiency approaches, data centers could reduce\ntheir electricity demand by 20 to 50 percent, according to the\nreport.

See the BPA press\nrelease at: <http://www.bpa.gov/Corporate/KCC/nr/02nr/nr011702.shtml>.\n\n\nSpire Solar Chicago Installs 100 Kilowatts of Solar Power\n\nSpire Solar Chicago, a business unit of Spire Corporation,\nannounced last week the installation of a total of 100 kilowatts\nof solar photovoltaic systems on six roofs in Chicago. The\nsystems were installed on the DuSable Museum of African\nAmerican History, the Homan Square Community Center,\nCommonwealth Edison's South Hydome facility, two Chicago\npublic schools, and a small commercial building. The\ninstallations are part of a local public/private partnership to\nproduce clean energy in Chicago. See the Spire press release\nat: <http://www.spirecorp.com/Spire/news/PV369.html>.\n\n\nDOT Proposes No Change in Light Truck Efficiency Standards\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nNHTSA), a part of the U.S. Department of Transportation\n(DOT), released last week its proposed fuel efficiency\nstandards for Model Year 2004 light trucks. The proposed\nstandard holds the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency\n(CAFE) standard for light trucks at its current level of\n20.7 miles per gallon. The light truck classification includes\nvans, pickup trucks, and most sport utility vehicles (SUVs).\n\nSince 1996, Congress has prohibited NHTSA from spending\nany funds to consider changes to the CAFE standards.\nAlthough that prohibition was lifted in December, the NHTSA\nclaims it has not had sufficient time to consider changes to\nthe standard. The NHTSA must issue its proposed rules\nearly enough to allow public comment and changes prior to a\nfinal rulemaking, which must be issued by April 1st. The\npublic is invited to provide comments on the proposed fuel\nefficiency standard before mid-February. See the January 18th\npress release on the NHTSA Web site at:\n<http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/nhtsa/announce/press/index.cfm>.\n\nOn January 14th, four days before the proposed standards\nwere released, the National Research Council (NRC) sent\nNHTSA a report confirming the NRC's conclusions on CAFE\nstandards, originally released in a detailed report published\nin July 2001. The reassessment was performed after the\ninitial report was challenged by the automotive industry. The\nlatest report reaffirms that \"technologies exist that, if applied\nto passenger cars and light-duty trucks, would significantly\nreduce fuel consumption within 15 years,\" and that\n\"assessment of currently offered product technologies\nsuggest that light-duty trucks, including SUVs, pickups, and\nminivans, offer the greatest potential to reduce fuel\nconsumption...\" See the new report on the National\nAcademy Press Web site at:\n<http://books.nap.edu/books/NI000377/html/R1.html>.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA), the overall fuel economy of light vehicles -- including\nboth light trucks and cars -- is now at a 21-year low of\n20.4 miles per gallon. Although car mileage has remained\nessentially flat for the past 16 years and light truck mileage\nhas stayed largely unchanged for the past 20 years, the\ngrowing market share of light trucks has dragged down the\noverall fuel economy of light vehicles. See the EPA \"Light\nDuty Automotive Technology and Fuel Economy Trends\"\nWeb page at: <http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fetrends.htm>.\n\nNote that actual fuel economies can be lower than the CAFE\nstandards for a number of reasons, including the fact that\nmanufacturers earn credits for any alternative-fuel vehicles\nthat they sell. Some manufacturers also fall below the\nstandards and pay penalties. To see how the details of how\nmanufacturers are meeting the standards, see the NHTSA\nreport on Model Year 2000 CAFE standards at:\n<http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/studies/fuelecon/index.html>.\n\n\nReal-World Test of Superconductor Cable Delayed\n\nA test of a high-temperature superconductor (HTS) cable at\na Detroit Edison substation has been delayed indefinitely.\nAccording to American Superconductor Corporation, which\nmade the HTS wires for the cables, a problem with the\nvacuum insulating system used to help keep the cables cool\nis preventing Detroit Edison from placing the HTS cables into\nservice. The company says the HTS wires met all their\nperformance requirements, and the vacuum insulating\ntechnology is a proven technology that would not be\nexpected to hinder the future use of HTS cables. Pirelli\nEnergy Cables and Systems, the cable manufacturer, is\nexpected to issue a revised timetable for the demonstration\nproject in spring.\n\nThe Detroit Edison substation is the site of the first\ninstallation and demonstration of an underground HTS cable\nin a U.S. utility network. The utility installed three 400-foot\ncables inside 4-inch-diameter underground ducts during the\nsummer of 2001. All other cable components, including the\ncryogenic cooling and vacuum insulating systems, were\ncompleted in the fall.\n\nAmerican Superconductor does have some good news,\nthough: its 5,000-horsepower HTS motor prototype, which\nuses HTS wires in its rotor winding (the part of the motor that\nrotates), was successfully tested at full load early this month.\nThe motor also successfully carried a peak load of 7,000\nhorsepower while running at its rated speed. Both the HTS\nrotor coils and the refrigeration system met or exceeded their\nperformance goals, and the system as a whole operated at\nan efficiency of 97.2 percent. The company claims it also\nidentified potential changes to the stator (the part of the\nmotor that stays still, or static) that could boost the efficiency\nof the motor to 97.7 percent. See the American Superconductor\npress releases at: <http://www.amsuper.com/press.htm>.\n\n\nReport Questions Government Support for Renewable Energy\n\nA report issued early this month by the Cato Institute, a\nnon-profit public policy research foundation, says that\ngovernment subsidies for renewable energy sources are\nunwarranted. The report says that renewable energy is not\nlikely to gain significant market share in the foreseeable\nfuture without a significant increase in government subsidies\nor mandates. The report also claims that the environmental\nbenefits of renewable energy could be achieved more\ncheaply using other technologies.\n\nThe report does acknowledge that government subsidies for\nfully commercialized fossil energy technologies -- oil, coal,\nand natural gas -- are nearly double those for renewable\nenergy, while nuclear and fossil fuels are also receiving\nmore research and development funds. It also suggests that\nnatural gas prices and availability will remain stable for the\nforeseeable future. See the Cato Institute press release, with\na link to the full report, at:\n<http://www.cato.org/new/01-02/01-08-02r-2.html>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nENERGY FACTS AND TIPS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nReport Claims Utilities are Struggling to Power Data Centers\n\nA report issued last week suggests that electric utilities are\nhaving a difficult time providing power to electronic data\ncenters, including so-called \"Internet hotels\" that provide\nservers for Web sites. The Platts report finds that such data\ncenters can consume from 8 to 50 times the electricity per\nsquare foot used by standard commercial buildings. For\ninstance, a 344,000-square-foot data center under\nconstruction in Washington State is expected to draw up to\n105 megawatts of power when it is complete. Such high\npower loads are causing some data centers to develop their\nown power sources. See the news release from Platts, one\nof The McGraw-Hill Companies, at:\n<http://www.platts.com/pressreleases/pressrelease2002-0118.shtml>.\n\nThe Platts report might be somewhat suspect, however, in\nlight of a report issued last summer by DOE's Lawrence\nBerkeley Laboratory (LBL). That report found that, for a\nvariety of reasons, data centers often greatly exaggerate\ntheir power needs. It concluded that data centers use at\nmost 50 watts per square foot, and usually closer to 40 watts\nper square foot. This number applies only to the computer\nroom part of the facility, and not surrounding office areas.\nUsing these figures, the data center in Washington would\nneed at most 17.2 megawatts of power -- probably much\nless. See the August 29th edition of EREN Network News at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2001/aug29_01.html>.\n\nA report released last month by the Renewable Energy\nPolicy Project (REPP) suggests that energy use in data\ncenters could be even lower. Using efficient servers,\nproperly sized and efficient cooling systems, and other\nenergy efficiency approaches, data centers could reduce\ntheir electricity demand by 20 to 50 percent, according to the\nreport. See the REPP announcement, with a link to the full\nreport, at:\n<http://www.crest.org/articles/static/1/1008083982_982708646.html>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nABOUT THIS NEWSLETTER\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can subscribe to this newsletter using the online form at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/subscribe/>.\nThis Web page also allows you to update your email address\nor unsubscribe to this newsletter.\n\nThe Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Network (EREN)\nhome page is located at <http://www.eren.doe.gov/>.\n\nIf you have questions or comments about this\nnewsletter, please contact the editor, Kevin Eber, at\nkevin_eber@nrel.gov.","messageId":"<14260970.1075861009018.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2002-01-23T05:30:03+05:30","from":"keber@mail.nrel.gov","subject":"EREN Network News -- 01/23/02","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"EREN <keber@mail.nrel.gov>","xTo":"eren@mail.nrel.gov","xFolder":"\\Richard_Ring_Mar2002\\Ring, Richard\\Deleted Items","xOrigin":"Ring-R","xFileName":"rring (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"eren@mail.nrel.gov"}

As everyone always advises, cancel\nyour credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free\nnumbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call.

Call the three national credit reporting organizations\nimmediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SS#.  I had never\nheard of doing that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an\napplication for credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert\nmeans any company that checks your credit knows your information was\nstolen and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit. By\n\nthe time I was advised to do this almost 2 weeks after the theft, all\nthe damage had been done. There are records of all the credit checks\ninitiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about before\nplacing the alert. Since then, no additional damage has been done, and\nthe thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in).

The annual Vernita Bar fish\noperation commenced on Thursday, reducing the amount of generation during\nthe peak hours, and increasing output over the light load hours.  \"During\nthe heavy load hours we can roughly generate about half of what we can for\nthe light load hours,\" said one hydro operator.  Some traders, however,\nquestioned the amount of impact the flow restrictions were having on the\ndailies.  \"Reduced hydroelectric output isn't the real market-moving force,\ngas is,\" said one analyst.  While spot gas prices dipped slightly on Friday,\nNYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts were sharply higher in moderate trade.\nThe gas contracts were propelled higher by some short covering ahead of the\nweekend, a cooler six-to-ten-day forecast, and long-term outlooks released\nearlier in the week calling for a \"colder-than-usual\" winter.  November Hub\ngas settled 19.5 cents higher at 2.681$/mmBtu, after reaching a session high\nof 2.72$/mmBtu.  December rose 19 cents to close at 2.99$/mmBtu.  Total U.S.\nstorage stood at 3.042 tcf, or about 92% full.  Some analysts believed that\ngas inventories could climb to a record 3.15 tcf in the three remaining\nweeks of stock-building season.\n\nDay-ahead energy costs in the Northwest got a good boost Friday on the\ntypical risk associated with trading three days out, and on reduced\nhydroelectric output during the peak hours.  A few traders seemed a little\nsurprised that off-peak prices rose by an average of 2.25$/MWh given that\nVernita Bar operations allow for more generation during the light load\nhours, but factor in all-day Sunday and there is no surprise.  Peak power at\nthe Mid-Columbia ranged from 26 to 28$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions\noccurring between 27 and 27.25$/MWh.  The only unit of consequence remaining\noff-line in the Northwest was Bridger #4 (520 MW), but the Wyoming-based\nthermal unit was expected to return over the weekend.  Weather forecasts\ncalled for normal temperatures into the first part of the new week, with the\npossibility of precipitation.  NOAA announced their winter forecast for the\nU.S. on Thursday, and said the Northwest can go either way as far as being\ncold or warm. They also said to expect more rain than last year.\n\nCalifornia electricity prices for Sunday and Monday strengthened in Friday\ntrade, with the light load prices up the most on the inclusion of the\nall-day Sunday block.  Peak prices at COB ranged from 26 to 28$/MWh,\nclimbing a buck, and off-peak goods traded between 23.5 and 24.5$/MWh,\nfirming up 1.5$/MWh on the low end and 50 cents on the high.  NP15 and SP15\npieces traded almost flat to one other, with NP15 at a slight premium. In\nfinancial news, California's DWR, the purchaser of power for most Golden\nState residents, revised its projected costs for buying electricity next\nyear down to $17.2 billion.  The 20% reduction was based mainly on the\ncontinued decline of spot electricity and natural gas prices.  Originally,\nthe DWR had expected to pay $21.45 billion for the procurement of power.\nDaytime temperatures for Monday and Tuesday were expected to be near normal,\nin the 65 to 75 degree range, while the latest six-to-ten called for\nabove-normal temperatures from October 25 to 29.  On the unit front,\ngas-fired Scattergood #3 (445 MW) was down for unplanned maintenance without\nan ETR.  On an up note, Sunrise Power Plant (338 MW) was nearing full power\nFriday morning.\n\nDespite a continued blanketing of above-normal temperatures, Monday's peak\npower prices in the Southwest were up only slightly from levels reported for\nthe Friday/Saturday package.  The price tag on light load energy rose more\nsubstantially, gaining as much as 2.75$/MWh at Palo Verde.  Heavy load\nenergy at the Southwest hub traded in a range of 26 to 28$/MWh, a rise of\nonly 50 cents on the low end.  There was little in the way of unit news on\nFriday.  Arizona-based Coronado #2 (385 MW) was expected to be back in\nservice sometime on Monday, following valve repairs.  Weather forecasts\ncalled for slight cooling early in the new week, but temperatures were\nexpected to remain at above-normal levels.  Furthermore, the latest\nsix-to-ten from the NWS was predicting above-normal temperatures for the\nentire desert region from October 25 through 29.\n\n\nPatrick O'Neill and Jessie Norris\n_________________________________________________________\n\nWestern Generating Unit Outages\n\nCurrent                            Begins          Ends          Reason\nCAISO units <250/5687 total          NA             NA\nplanned/unplanned*\nBridger #4/520/coal               17-Oct-01      20-Oct-01       repairs\nComanche #2/335/coal              29-Sep-01      30-Oct-01       maintenance\nContra Costa #7/337/gas           01-Sep-01         ?            planned\nCoronado #2/385/coal              18-Oct-01      22-Oct-01       maintenance\nCrockett Cogen/260/gas            15-Oct-01         ?            planned\nEl Segundo #3/337/gas             02-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nEtiwanda #3/320/gas               05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nEtiwanda #4/320/gas               05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nHelms PGP #2/407/hydro            01-Oct-01         ?            planned\nHyatt/Thermalito/900/hydro        02-Oct-01         ?        @ 250MW,\nplanned\nLos Medanos/550/gas               19-Oct-O1         ?            planned\nOrmond Beach #2/750/gas           05-Oct-01         ?      @ 350MW,\nunplanned\nPalo Verde #2/1270/nuke           10-Oct-01      30 days         maintenance\nPalo Verde #3/1270/nuke           29-Sep-01      03-Nov-01\nrefuel/maint.\nRawhide/255/coal                  18-Oct-01      20-Oct-01       tube leak\nSan Onofre #2/1070/nuke           14-Oct-01      02-Nov-01       maintenance\nScattergood #3/445/gas            18-Oct-01         ?            unplanned*\n\nFuture\nSan Juan #4/534/coal              20-Oct-01      11-Nov-01      maintenance\n\nFor unit owners refer to pdf version.\n*Indicates a change from previous EMR.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nEastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)\n\nOctober 19, 2001 for October 22, 2001\n\nPeak (Heavy) in $/MWh\n                 Low     Change   High      Change\nInto Cinergy    19.50    -2.25    22.00     -2.00\nWestern PJM     24.90    -0.35    26.25      0.75\nInto Entergy    20.00     0.00    21.50      0.50\nInto TVA        21.00    -1.00    22.00     -1.00\n___________________________________________________________\nAmid expectations of warmer weather for Monday and little news of\ncurtailments, peak power prices for Monday delivery posted mixed results\nacross the Eastern Interconnect in Friday trade.  Daytime temperatures\nreached the mid-60s in the Midwest and along the northern seaboard, with 70\nto 75 degree ranges seen in the south.  Monday temperatures were expected to\nbe warmer, but the hot flash should be short-lived as below normal\ntemperatures were forecast for October 25 to 29.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas\ncontracts rose substantially in end-of-the-week trade.  November climbed\n19.5 cents to close at 2.681$/mmBtu, while December gained 19 cents to end\nat 2.990$/mmBtu.\n\nHeavy load energy costs for Monday delivery were seen trading in a slightly\nwider range on Friday, gaining ground on the high end.  Western PJM goods\nchanged hands between 24.9 and 26.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done\naround 25.5$/MWh.  November forward contracts climbed as well, with\nunconfirmed trades as high as 27.95$/MWh.  New England nuke Seabrook #1\n(1161 MW), down since Monday, was expected to return to service over the\nweekend, and with Nine Mile Point 2 (1142 MW) back as well, sellers\nanticipated less demand from NEPOOL in the new week.  LMPs were averaging\n22.18$/MWh through 16:00 EDT, after a brief mid-morning spike to 61$/MWh.\nActual loads were drifting below forecasted loads for most of the afternoon.\nTemperatures through Tuesday were expected to be above normal in the 50s and\n60s, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for below-normal\ntemperatures from October 25 to 29.\n\nIn the Midwest, peak power prices fell in Friday trade, with predictions of\nwarmer weather for Monday.  Into Cinergy goods were bought and sold between\n19.5 and 22$/MWh, with most trades in the 21 to 21.8$/MWh range.  November\nforward contracts also rose, with reported prices as high as 23.3$/MWh.\nDaytime temperatures for the early part of the new week were expected in the\n60s and 70s, with mild overnights.  The most current six-to-ten called for\nbelow-normal temperatures from October 25 to 29.\n\nIn the Southeast, peak power prices stayed mostly steady on Friday.  Into\nEntergy pieces were exchanged between 20 and 21.5$/MWh.  Electricity prices\ninto TVA ranged from 21 to 22$/MWh.  In unit news, nuke Surry #1 (781 MW)\nentered its fall refueling outage, while fellow nuke Hatch #2 (813 MW) was\nexpected to exit its refueling outage over the weekend.  Weather across the\nregion was expected to be warmer Monday and Tuesday, with daytime\ntemperatures in the 75 to 83 degree range.  However, the latest six-to-ten\npredicted normal to below-normal temperatures from October 25 to 29.\n___________________________________________________________\nCalifornia ISO Congestion Index in $/MWh\n\n\n                         Path                 Peak   Off-peak\nfor 20-Oct-01         NW1 to NP15             0.00     0.00\n                      NW3 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      AZ3 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      LC1 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      SP15 to NP15            0.00     0.00\n\n\n\nOTC Forward Peak Electricity Contracts in $/MWh\n\n                Mid-C            PV             SP-15\n            Bid     Ask     Bid     Ask     Bid      Ask\nBOM        25.75   26.25   27.25   27.75   27.50   28.00\nNovember   28.00   28.50   27.25   27.75   28.50   29.00\nDecember   36.00   36.50   31.50   32.25   33.50   34.50\nQ1 '02     33.25   34.00   31.75   32.00   33.25   33.75\nQ2 '02     27.50   28.50   35.00   36.00   34.00   34.50\nQ3 '02     44.00   45.00   52.00   52.75   48.25   49.00\nQ4 '02     36.75   37.50   36.00   36.50   37.00   37.25\nCal '03    38.00   39.00   40.50   41.50   43.00   43.50\n\nRepresents the most recent bid/ask spread obtainable\nby the Energy Market Report.\n\n\n\nAlberta Power Pool Index (C$/MWh)\n\n                    Peak(14)   Peak(16)   Off-Peak       Flat    Change\nfor  18-Oct-01      108.87     102.54      34.67        82.16     27.33\n\n\n\nBPA's Offer in $/MWh\n\nHours     Amount          NW               COB           NOB\n\n\nBPA has no offer until further notice.\n\n\n\nNYMEX Henry Hub Gas Futures in $/mmBtu\n\n                 Close        Change\n        Nov      2.681         0.195\n        Dec      2.990         0.190\n\n\n\nNatural Gas Spot Prices in $/mmBtu\n\n                  Low          High\nSumas             2.03         2.08\nSo.

The annual Vernita Bar fish\noperation commenced on Thursday, reducing the amount of generation during\nthe peak hours, and increasing output over the light load hours.  \"During\nthe heavy load hours we can roughly generate about half of what we can for\nthe light load hours,\" said one hydro operator.  Some traders, however,\nquestioned the amount of impact the flow restrictions were having on the\ndailies.  \"Reduced hydroelectric output isn't the real market-moving force,\ngas is,\" said one analyst.  While spot gas prices dipped slightly on Friday,\nNYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts were sharply higher in moderate trade.\nThe gas contracts were propelled higher by some short covering ahead of the\nweekend, a cooler six-to-ten-day forecast, and long-term outlooks released\nearlier in the week calling for a \"colder-than-usual\" winter.  November Hub\ngas settled 19.5 cents higher at 2.681$/mmBtu, after reaching a session high\nof 2.72$/mmBtu.  December rose 19 cents to close at 2.99$/mmBtu.  Total U.S.\nstorage stood at 3.042 tcf, or about 92% full.  Some analysts believed that\ngas inventories could climb to a record 3.15 tcf in the three remaining\nweeks of stock-building season.\n\nDay-ahead energy costs in the Northwest got a good boost Friday on the\ntypical risk associated with trading three days out, and on reduced\nhydroelectric output during the peak hours.  A few traders seemed a little\nsurprised that off-peak prices rose by an average of 2.25$/MWh given that\nVernita Bar operations allow for more generation during the light load\nhours, but factor in all-day Sunday and there is no surprise.  Peak power at\nthe Mid-Columbia ranged from 26 to 28$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions\noccurring between 27 and 27.25$/MWh.  The only unit of consequence remaining\noff-line in the Northwest was Bridger #4 (520 MW), but the Wyoming-based\nthermal unit was expected to return over the weekend.  Weather forecasts\ncalled for normal temperatures into the first part of the new week, with the\npossibility of precipitation.  NOAA announced their winter forecast for the\nU.S. on Thursday, and said the Northwest can go either way as far as being\ncold or warm. They also said to expect more rain than last year.\n\nCalifornia electricity prices for Sunday and Monday strengthened in Friday\ntrade, with the light load prices up the most on the inclusion of the\nall-day Sunday block.  Peak prices at COB ranged from 26 to 28$/MWh,\nclimbing a buck, and off-peak goods traded between 23.5 and 24.5$/MWh,\nfirming up 1.5$/MWh on the low end and 50 cents on the high.  NP15 and SP15\npieces traded almost flat to one other, with NP15 at a slight premium. In\nfinancial news, California's DWR, the purchaser of power for most Golden\nState residents, revised its projected costs for buying electricity next\nyear down to $17.2 billion.  The 20% reduction was based mainly on the\ncontinued decline of spot electricity and natural gas prices.  Originally,\nthe DWR had expected to pay $21.45 billion for the procurement of power.\nDaytime temperatures for Monday and Tuesday were expected to be near normal,\nin the 65 to 75 degree range, while the latest six-to-ten called for\nabove-normal temperatures from October 25 to 29.  On the unit front,\ngas-fired Scattergood #3 (445 MW) was down for unplanned maintenance without\nan ETR.  On an up note, Sunrise Power Plant (338 MW) was nearing full power\nFriday morning.\n\nDespite a continued blanketing of above-normal temperatures, Monday's peak\npower prices in the Southwest were up only slightly from levels reported for\nthe Friday/Saturday package.  The price tag on light load energy rose more\nsubstantially, gaining as much as 2.75$/MWh at Palo Verde.  Heavy load\nenergy at the Southwest hub traded in a range of 26 to 28$/MWh, a rise of\nonly 50 cents on the low end.  There was little in the way of unit news on\nFriday.  Arizona-based Coronado #2 (385 MW) was expected to be back in\nservice sometime on Monday, following valve repairs.  Weather forecasts\ncalled for slight cooling early in the new week, but temperatures were\nexpected to remain at above-normal levels.

Daytime temperatures\nreached the mid-60s in the Midwest and along the northern seaboard, with 70\nto 75 degree ranges seen in the south.  Monday temperatures were expected to\nbe warmer, but the hot flash should be short-lived as below normal\ntemperatures were forecast for October 25 to 29.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas\ncontracts rose substantially in end-of-the-week trade.

November forward contracts climbed as well, with\nunconfirmed trades as high as 27.95$/MWh.  New England nuke Seabrook #1\n(1161 MW), down since Monday, was expected to return to service over the\nweekend, and with Nine Mile Point 2 (1142 MW) back as well, sellers\nanticipated less demand from NEPOOL in the new week.  LMPs were averaging\n22.18$/MWh through 16:00 EDT, after a brief mid-morning spike to 61$/MWh.\nActual loads were drifting below forecasted loads for most of the afternoon.\nTemperatures through Tuesday were expected to be above normal in the 50s and\n60s, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for below-normal\ntemperatures from October 25 to 29.\n\nIn the Midwest, peak power prices fell in Friday trade, with predictions of\nwarmer weather for Monday.  Into Cinergy goods were bought and sold between\n19.5 and 22$/MWh, with most trades in the 21 to 21.8$/MWh range.  November\nforward contracts also rose, with reported prices as high as 23.3$/MWh.\nDaytime temperatures for the early part of the new week were expected in the\n60s and 70s, with mild overnights.  The most current six-to-ten called for\nbelow-normal temperatures from October 25 to 29.\n\nIn the Southeast, peak power prices stayed mostly steady on Friday.  Into\nEntergy pieces were exchanged between 20 and 21.5$/MWh.  Electricity prices\ninto TVA ranged from 21 to 22$/MWh.  In unit news, nuke Surry #1 (781 MW)\nentered its fall refueling outage, while fellow nuke Hatch #2 (813 MW) was\nexpected to exit its refueling outage over the weekend.

Several players, however, were\nsurprised by the relative strength of the weekend package.  \"We were\nexpecting more of a downside in the dailies today, but who's complaining,\"\nsaid one seller.  While spot gas prices were heading lower on Thursday,\nNYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts were moving up, albeit slightly.  Gas\ncontracts for the front months rose on some late-session short covering, but\nfailed to make up for the more substantial losses that occurred on\nWednesday.  November Hub gas gained 6.8 cents to settle at 2.486$/mmBtu,\nwhile December rose 9.7 cents to end at 2.8$/mmBtu.  On the national front,\na threat against the Three Mile Island nuclear plant served as a wake-up\ncall about the vulnerability of the nation's energy supplies.  Some U.S.\nsenators have urged that billions of dollars be spent to protect American\noil refineries, natural gas pipelines, hydropower dams, and nuclear power\nplants.  \"The very word 'security' has changed dramatically where it's now\nsynonymous with anti-terrorism,\" said one source.\n\nHeavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by an average of 1.25$/MWh for\nthe weekend package.  Lower demand and weaker spot gas values were the most\noft-cited explanations given for the softer dailies.  The spread between\npeak and off-peak prices narrowed slightly on Thursday, and was expected to\nshrink further, as fish mitigation procedures went into effect Wednesday\nnight.  The Vernita Bar operations, which are scheduled to last until\nNovember 22, effectively reduce generation during the on-peak hours, while\nbeefing up generation over the off-peak hours.  Flow forecasts for Chief\nJoseph came in at 60 kcfs Friday, 45 kcfs Saturday, 40 kcfs Sunday, 70 kcfs\nMonday, and 65 kcfs next Tuesday through Thursday.  Weather forecasts for\nthe region's major load centers called for normal to slightly below-normal\ntemperatures into early next week.\n\nCalifornia electricity prices for the Friday/Saturday package weakened in a\nvolatile day of trading on Thursday.  Some players were sitting on the\nsidelines Thursday, one saying, \"I'm not buying in the dailies.  I think\nreal-time prices will be better [less expensive] over the weekend.\"   In\nother developments, the federal government reached an agreement with a\ncoalition of energy companies to build new transmission along Path 15.  The\nnew power lines were projected to cost $300 million and result in relief of\nthe current price-raising bottleneck during high demand times.  The new Path\n15 would have a 1500 MW capacity.  In political news, California Governor\nDavis hopped on the renegotiating-long-term-contracts bandwagon, much to the\nrelief of his fellow Democrats in the state legislature.  Renegotiation is\nstrongly opposed by the suppliers holding those contracts.  In unit news,\nAlamitos #3 (320 MW), Encina #5 (332 MW), and Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) were\nall back at full power on Thursday.  Daytime temperatures stayed in the\ncomfortable low-70s on Thursday, 5 to 10 degrees warmer across southern\ninland regions, and were expected to stay within 2 to 3 degrees of normal\nthrough Monday.  The latest six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures\nfrom October 24 to 28.\n\nDespite some unseasonably warm temperatures, heavy load energy costs in the\nSouthwest sunk for the Friday/Saturday duo.  Falling spot gas prices were\nalso given some of the credit for the weaker day-ahead market.  Peak power\nat Palo Verde saw action between 25.5 and 28$/MWh, with the highest prices\nheard late in the trading session.  In unit news, Four Corners #4 (750 MW)\nreturned to service following tube leak repairs that began last weekend, but\nArizona-based Coronado #2 (385 MW) was brought down for valve replacement\nscheduled to last until Monday, October 22.  Weather forecasts called for\ncooling on Sunday and Monday, but the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was\npredicting a return to above-normal temperatures from October 24 through 28.\n\n\nPatrick O'Neill and Jessie Norris\n_________________________________________________________\n\nWestern Generating Unit Outages\n\nCurrent                            Begins          Ends          Reason\nCAISO units <250/5429 total          NA             NA\nplanned/unplanned*\nBridger #4/520/coal               17-Oct-01      20-Oct-01       repairs\nComanche #2/335/coal              29-Sep-01      30-Oct-01       maintenance\nContra Costa #7/337/gas           01-Sep-01         ?            planned\nCoronado #2/385/coal              18-Oct-01      22-Oct-01\nmaintenance*\nCrockett Cogen/260/gas            15-Oct-01         ?            planned\nEl Segundo #3/337/gas             02-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nEtiwanda #3/320/gas               05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nEtiwanda #4/320/gas               05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nHelms PGP #2/407/hydro            01-Oct-01         ?            planned\nHyatt/Thermalito/900/hydro        02-Oct-01         ?        @ 250MW,\nplanned\nLos Medanos/550/gas               17-Oct-01         ?        @ 125MW,\nplanned\nOrmond Beach #2/750/gas           05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nPalo Verde #2/1270/nuke           10-Oct-01      30 days         maintenance\nPalo Verde #3/1270/nuke           29-Sep-01      03-Nov-01\nrefuel/maint.\nRawhide/255/coal                  18-Oct-01      20-Oct-01       tube leak*\nSan Onofre #2/1070/nuke           14-Oct-01      02-Nov-01       maintenance\nSunrise Power Plant/338/gas       17-Oct-01         ?            planned\n\nFuture\nSan Juan #4/534/coal              20-Oct-01      11-Nov-01      maintenance\n\nFor unit owners refer to pdf version.\n*Indicates a change from previous EMR.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nEastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)\n\nOctober 18, 2001 for October 19, 2001\n\nPeak (Heavy) in $/MWh\n                 Low     Change   High      Change\nInto Cinergy    21.75     0.25    24.00      0.65\nWestern PJM     25.25    -0.75    25.50     -1.50\nInto Entergy    20.00    -0.50    21.00     -0.45\nInto TVA        22.00     0.50    23.00     -1.25\n___________________________________________________________\nSpot power prices across the Eastern Interconnect mostly weakened in\nThursday trade, as expectations for warmer weather on Friday and into the\nweekend took their toll on demand.  While Thursday remained cool, with\ndaytime temperatures 5 to 11 degrees below normal, Friday temperatures were\nexpected in the 60s and 70s across most of the regions.  Overnight lows were\nexpected to climb out of heating demand range by Saturday.  In more somber\nnews, Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island #1 (786 MW) heightened its already\nstringent security measures in cooperation with state and federal\nauthorities, after a threat to the nuclear unit was received on Wednesday.\nHowever, by Thursday the threat was deemed non-credible, and refueling\nmaintenance was allowed to continue.  NYMEX Henry Hub futures edged up on\nThursday, but reclaimed only a fraction of Wednesday's losses.  November\ngained 6.8 cents to close at 2.486$/mmBtu, and December rose 9.7 cents to\nend at 2.80$/mmBtu.\n\nIn the Mid-Atlantic, heavy load energy costs fell on Thursday, as off-line\ngeneration declined for the third day in a row and weather forecasts for\nFriday called for warming.  Western PJM goods were trading in a narrow range\nfrom 25.25 to 25.5$/MWh, losing 1.5$/MWh off the high end, and 0.75$/MWh off\nthe low.  LMPs affected daily prices less on Thursday, fluctuating between\n20 and 30$/MWh after the usual early morning spike.  Weather was cool, with\ndaytime highs only in the low-60s and overnight lows in the low-40s.\nTemperatures were predicted to increase, reaching above-normal ranges for\nthe weekend and Monday.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for\nbelow-normal temperatures for October 24 to 28.  On the unit front, there\nwere no new nuclear plants off-line, allowing Western PJM room to export\nsome surplus generation.\n\nPeak power prices in the Midwest remained steady for most of the day, as\ntemperatures were expected to warm up through the weekend.  Into Cinergy\npieces traded in the range from 21.75 to 24$/MWh, climbing slightly to a day\nago.  The bulk of deals were completed between 22 and 22.5$/MWh, with the\n24$/MWh seen very late in the trading session.  Loads were light on\nThursday, and expected to stay that way, with temperatures across the\nregions warming over the weekend.  Above-normal temperatures were expected\nby Sunday, continuing into Monday with daytime highs in the low-70s.  The\nlatest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures for October 24 to 28.\nGeneration remained very healthy across ECAR on Thursday, but fall refueling\noutages at Surry #1 (781 MW) and Fermi #2 (1,085 MW) were expected in the\nnear future.\n\nPeak power prices in SERC lost ground on Thursday, as weather was expected\nto warm back up for the weekend.  Daytime high temperatures in the\nlow-to-mid 60s were seen across most of the region, about 10 degrees below\nnormal, and expected to warm into the mid-to-upper 70s by Saturday.  The\nmost current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from October 24 to 28.\nInto Entergy prices held steady, with goods changing hands from 20 to\n21$/MWh, and the bulk of trades in the 20.25 to 20.50$/MWh range.  Into TVA\ntransacted between 22 and 23$/MWh.  No new information was available on\noutages in the region.\n___________________________________________________________\nCalifornia ISO Congestion Index in $/MWh\n\n\n                         Path                 Peak   Off-peak\nfor 19-Oct-01         NW1 to NP15             0.00     0.00\n                      NW3 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      AZ3 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      LC1 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      SP15 to NP15            0.00     0.00\n\n\n\nOTC Forward Peak Electricity Contracts in $/MWh\n\n                Mid-C            PV             SP-15\n            Bid     Ask     Bid     Ask     Bid      Ask\nBOM        25.75   26.25   27.25   27.75   27.50   28.00\nNovember   28.00   28.50   27.25   27.75   28.50   29.00\nDecember   36.00   36.50   31.50   32.25   33.50   34.50\nQ1 '02     33.25   34.00   31.75   32.00   33.25   33.75\nQ2 '02     27.50   28.50   35.00   36.00   34.00   34.50\nQ3 '02     44.00   45.00   52.00   52.75   48.25   49.00\nQ4 '02     36.75   37.50   36.00   36.50   37.00   37.25\nCal '03    38.00   39.00   40.50   41.50   43.00   43.50\n\nRepresents the most recent bid/ask spread obtainable\nby the Energy Market Report.\n\n\n\nAlberta Power Pool Index (C$/MWh)\n\n                    Peak(14)   Peak(16)   Off-Peak       Flat    Change\nfor  17-Oct-01       68.72      65.20      30.87        54.83      3.93\n\n\n\nBPA's Offer in $/MWh\n\nHours     Amount          NW               COB           NOB\n\n\nBPA has no offer until further notice.\n\n\n\nNYMEX Henry Hub Gas Futures in $/mmBtu\n\n                 Close        Change\n        Nov      2.486         0.068\n        Dec      2.800         0.097\n\n\n\nNatural Gas Spot Prices in $/mmBtu\n\n                  Low          High\nSumas             2.06         2.11\nSo.

Several players, however, were\nsurprised by the relative strength of the weekend package.  \"We were\nexpecting more of a downside in the dailies today, but who's complaining,\"\nsaid one seller.  While spot gas prices were heading lower on Thursday,\nNYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts were moving up, albeit slightly.  Gas\ncontracts for the front months rose on some late-session short covering, but\nfailed to make up for the more substantial losses that occurred on\nWednesday.  November Hub gas gained 6.8 cents to settle at 2.486$/mmBtu,\nwhile December rose 9.7 cents to end at 2.8$/mmBtu.  On the national front,\na threat against the Three Mile Island nuclear plant served as a wake-up\ncall about the vulnerability of the nation's energy supplies.  Some U.S.\nsenators have urged that billions of dollars be spent to protect American\noil refineries, natural gas pipelines, hydropower dams, and nuclear power\nplants.  \"The very word 'security' has changed dramatically where it's now\nsynonymous with anti-terrorism,\" said one source.\n\nHeavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by an average of 1.25$/MWh for\nthe weekend package.  Lower demand and weaker spot gas values were the most\noft-cited explanations given for the softer dailies.  The spread between\npeak and off-peak prices narrowed slightly on Thursday, and was expected to\nshrink further, as fish mitigation procedures went into effect Wednesday\nnight.  The Vernita Bar operations, which are scheduled to last until\nNovember 22, effectively reduce generation during the on-peak hours, while\nbeefing up generation over the off-peak hours.  Flow forecasts for Chief\nJoseph came in at 60 kcfs Friday, 45 kcfs Saturday, 40 kcfs Sunday, 70 kcfs\nMonday, and 65 kcfs next Tuesday through Thursday.  Weather forecasts for\nthe region's major load centers called for normal to slightly below-normal\ntemperatures into early next week.\n\nCalifornia electricity prices for the Friday/Saturday package weakened in a\nvolatile day of trading on Thursday.  Some players were sitting on the\nsidelines Thursday, one saying, \"I'm not buying in the dailies.  I think\nreal-time prices will be better [less expensive] over the weekend.\"   In\nother developments, the federal government reached an agreement with a\ncoalition of energy companies to build new transmission along Path 15.  The\nnew power lines were projected to cost $300 million and result in relief of\nthe current price-raising bottleneck during high demand times.  The new Path\n15 would have a 1500 MW capacity.  In political news, California Governor\nDavis hopped on the renegotiating-long-term-contracts bandwagon, much to the\nrelief of his fellow Democrats in the state legislature.  Renegotiation is\nstrongly opposed by the suppliers holding those contracts.  In unit news,\nAlamitos #3 (320 MW), Encina #5 (332 MW), and Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) were\nall back at full power on Thursday.  Daytime temperatures stayed in the\ncomfortable low-70s on Thursday, 5 to 10 degrees warmer across southern\ninland regions, and were expected to stay within 2 to 3 degrees of normal\nthrough Monday.  The latest six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures\nfrom October 24 to 28.\n\nDespite some unseasonably warm temperatures, heavy load energy costs in the\nSouthwest sunk for the Friday/Saturday duo.  Falling spot gas prices were\nalso given some of the credit for the weaker day-ahead market.  Peak power\nat Palo Verde saw action between 25.5 and 28$/MWh, with the highest prices\nheard late in the trading session.  In unit news, Four Corners #4 (750 MW)\nreturned to service following tube leak repairs that began last weekend, but\nArizona-based Coronado #2 (385 MW) was brought down for valve replacement\nscheduled to last until Monday, October 22.  Weather forecasts called for\ncooling on Sunday and Monday, but the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was\npredicting a return to above-normal temperatures from October 24 through 28.\n\n\nPatrick O'Neill and Jessie Norris\n_________________________________________________________\n\nWestern Generating Unit Outages\n\nCurrent                            Begins          Ends          Reason\nCAISO units <250/5429 total          NA             NA\nplanned/unplanned*\nBridger #4/520/coal               17-Oct-01      20-Oct-01       repairs\nComanche #2/335/coal              29-Sep-01      30-Oct-01       maintenance\nContra Costa #7/337/gas           01-Sep-01         ?            planned\nCoronado #2/385/coal              18-Oct-01      22-Oct-01\nmaintenance*\nCrockett Cogen/260/gas            15-Oct-01         ?            planned\nEl Segundo #3/337/gas             02-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nEtiwanda #3/320/gas               05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nEtiwanda #4/320/gas               05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nHelms PGP #2/407/hydro            01-Oct-01         ?            planned\nHyatt/Thermalito/900/hydro        02-Oct-01         ?        @ 250MW,\nplanned\nLos Medanos/550/gas               17-Oct-01         ?        @ 125MW,\nplanned\nOrmond Beach #2/750/gas           05-Oct-01         ?            unplanned\nPalo Verde #2/1270/nuke           10-Oct-01      30 days         maintenance\nPalo Verde #3/1270/nuke           29-Sep-01      03-Nov-01\nrefuel/maint.\nRawhide/255/coal                  18-Oct-01      20-Oct-01       tube leak*\nSan Onofre #2/1070/nuke           14-Oct-01      02-Nov-01       maintenance\nSunrise Power Plant/338/gas       17-Oct-01         ?            planned\n\nFuture\nSan Juan #4/534/coal              20-Oct-01      11-Nov-01      maintenance\n\nFor unit owners refer to pdf version.\n*Indicates a change from previous EMR.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nEastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)\n\nOctober 18, 2001 for October 19, 2001\n\nPeak (Heavy) in $/MWh\n                 Low     Change   High      Change\nInto Cinergy    21.75     0.25    24.00      0.65\nWestern PJM     25.25    -0.75    25.50     -1.50\nInto Entergy    20.00    -0.50    21.00     -0.45\nInto TVA        22.00     0.50    23.00     -1.25\n___________________________________________________________\nSpot power prices across the Eastern Interconnect mostly weakened in\nThursday trade, as expectations for warmer weather on Friday and into the\nweekend took their toll on demand.  While Thursday remained cool, with\ndaytime temperatures 5 to 11 degrees below normal, Friday temperatures were\nexpected in the 60s and 70s across most of the regions.  Overnight lows were\nexpected to climb out of heating demand range by Saturday.  In more somber\nnews, Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island #1 (786 MW) heightened its already\nstringent security measures in cooperation with state and federal\nauthorities, after a threat to the nuclear unit was received on Wednesday.\nHowever, by Thursday the threat was deemed non-credible, and refueling\nmaintenance was allowed to continue.  NYMEX Henry Hub futures edged up on\nThursday, but reclaimed only a fraction of Wednesday's losses.  November\ngained 6.8 cents to close at 2.486$/mmBtu, and December rose 9.7 cents to\nend at 2.80$/mmBtu.\n\nIn the Mid-Atlantic, heavy load energy costs fell on Thursday, as off-line\ngeneration declined for the third day in a row and weather forecasts for\nFriday called for warming.  Western PJM goods were trading in a narrow range\nfrom 25.25 to 25.5$/MWh, losing 1.5$/MWh off the high end, and 0.75$/MWh off\nthe low.  LMPs affected daily prices less on Thursday, fluctuating between\n20 and 30$/MWh after the usual early morning spike.  Weather was cool, with\ndaytime highs only in the low-60s and overnight lows in the low-40s.\nTemperatures were predicted to increase, reaching above-normal ranges for\nthe weekend and Monday.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for\nbelow-normal temperatures for October 24 to 28.  On the unit front, there\nwere no new nuclear plants off-line, allowing Western PJM room to export\nsome surplus generation.\n\nPeak power prices in the Midwest remained steady for most of the day, as\ntemperatures were expected to warm up through the weekend.  Into Cinergy\npieces traded in the range from 21.75 to 24$/MWh, climbing slightly to a day\nago.  The bulk of deals were completed between 22 and 22.5$/MWh, with the\n24$/MWh seen very late in the trading session.  Loads were light on\nThursday, and expected to stay that way, with temperatures across the\nregions warming over the weekend.  Above-normal temperatures were expected\nby Sunday, continuing into Monday with daytime highs in the low-70s.  The\nlatest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures for October 24 to 28.\nGeneration remained very healthy across ECAR on Thursday, but fall refueling\noutages at Surry #1 (781 MW) and Fermi #2 (1,085 MW) were expected in the\nnear future.\n\nPeak power prices in SERC lost ground on Thursday, as weather was expected\nto warm back up for the weekend.  Daytime high temperatures in the\nlow-to-mid 60s were seen across most of the region, about 10 degrees below\nnormal, and expected to warm into the mid-to-upper 70s by Saturday.  The\nmost current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from October 24 to 28.\nInto Entergy prices held steady, with goods changing hands from 20 to\n21$/MWh, and the bulk of trades in the 20.25 to 20.50$/MWh range.  Into TVA\ntransacted between 22 and 23$/MWh.  No new information was available on\noutages in the region.\n___________________________________________________________\nCalifornia ISO Congestion Index in $/MWh\n\n\n                         Path                 Peak   Off-peak\nfor 19-Oct-01         NW1 to NP15             0.00     0.00\n                      NW3 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      AZ3 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      LC1 to SP15             0.00     0.00\n                      SP15 to NP15            0.00     0.00\n\n\n\nOTC Forward Peak Electricity Contracts in $/MWh\n\n                Mid-C            PV             SP-15\n            Bid     Ask     Bid     Ask     Bid      Ask\nBOM        25.75   26.25   27.25   27.75   27.50   28.00\nNovember   28.00   28.50   27.25   27.75   28.50   29.00\nDecember   36.00   36.50   31.50   32.25   33.50   34.50\nQ1 '02     33.25   34.00   31.75   32.00   33.25   33.75\nQ2 '02     27.50   28.50   35.00   36.00   34.00   34.50\nQ3 '02     44.00   45.00   52.00   52.75   48.25   49.00\nQ4 '02     36.75   37.50   36.00   36.50   37.00   37.25\nCal '03    38.00   39.00   40.50   41.50   43.00   43.50\n\nRepresents the most recent bid/ask spread obtainable\nby the Energy Market Report.\n\n\n\nAlberta Power Pool Index (C$/MWh)\n\n                    Peak(14)   Peak(16)   Off-Peak       Flat    Change\nfor  17-Oct-01       68.72      65.20      30.87        54.83      3.93\n\n\n\nBPA's Offer in $/MWh\n\nHours     Amount          NW               COB           NOB\n\n\nBPA has no offer until further notice.\n\n\n\nNYMEX Henry Hub Gas Futures in $/mmBtu\n\n                 Close        Change\n        Nov      2.486         0.068\n        Dec      2.800         0.097\n\n\n\nNatural Gas Spot Prices in $/mmBtu\n\n                  Low          High\nSumas             2.06         2.11\nSo.

Although the budget emphasis is on the war on\nterrorism and U.S. homeland security, the budget maintains\nfunding for energy efficiency and renewable energy\nprograms, while providing new tax incentives to encourage\nthe use of these technologies (see second story below). See\nthe full budget on the White House Web site at:\n<http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2003/>.\n\nThe proposed overall budget for DOE's Office of Energy\nEfficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), which funds this\nnewsletter and the EREN Web site, remains nearly steady,\nincreasing about 0.8 percent above FY 2002 funding levels.\nFunding for renewable energy programs increases 5.5 percent\nin the budget, with significant funding boosts for hydrogen,\nhydropower, and solar building technology research and\ndevelopment, as well as for programs that encourage\nrenewable energy use on Indian reservations and internationally.\nHowever, the research budget for concentrating solar power\ntechnologies suffers a cut of 86 percent.\n\nOverall funding for energy efficiency programs decreases by\nabout 1.3 percent. The largest change is a budget increase\nof 25 percent for the Federal Energy Management Program,\nwhich helps the federal government reduce its energy use.\nEERE estimates that the combined energy efficiency and\nrenewable energy programs, which cost about $1.3 billion\nper year, will save the country between $76 billion and\n$125 billion in energy costs by 2020.\n\nSee EERE's \"Budget-in-Brief\" on the EREN Web site at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/budget/budget_summary03.html>.\n\nSee also the \"Renewable Energy Resources\" and \"Energy\nConservation\" sections under the \"Detailed Budget\nJustifications\" heading of DOE's budget request, posted at:\n<http://www.mbe.doe.gov/budget/03budget/index.htm>.\n\nIn his announcement of the DOE budget, Secretary of\nEnergy Spencer Abraham specifically noted that the\nproposed budget will support the President's commitment to\ndouble funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program\nover the next 10 years, and will provide roughly $150 million\nfor FreedomCAR, which aims to develop the infrastructure\nand technologies needed for hydrogen-powered fuel-cell\nvehicles. See the DOE press release at:\n<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases02/febpr/pr02016.htm>.\n\nThe administration's proposed budget is only the first step in\nthe budget process. Both the House and Senate will now\nstart working on a series of bills to set a budget and appropriate\nfunds. For FY 2002, for instance, the President's budget\noriginally proposed cutting funding for EERE, but as shown\nin the budget documents cited above, funding for FY 2002\nended up higher than the previous year's funding. See the\nnews about last year's proposed budget in the April 11,\n2001, edition of the EREN Network News at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2001/apr11_01.html>.\n\n\nBudget Includes Tax Incentives for Renewables, CHP, Hybrids\n\nThe President's budget for fiscal year 2002 includes\n$9.1 billion in tax incentives over 10 years to encourage the\nuse of renewable energy, combined heat and power (CHP)\nsystems, and energy-efficient vehicles.\n\nFor power producers, the budget includes a new 10-percent\ninvestment tax credit for qualifying CHP systems, an\nextension of the tax credit for landfill methane power plants,\nan extension of the production tax credit (PTC) through\n2005, and an expansion of the PTC to include more biomass\nenergy facilities. The PTC provides renewable power\nproducers with a tax break of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (in\n1992 dollars, adjusted for inflation) and was formerly\napplicable only to electricity produced from wind power,\npoultry waste, and biomass power produced from dedicated\nenergy crops.\n\nThe PTC expired in December, leading to a slowdown in the\nwind energy business. For example, Vestas Wind Systems\nA/S shifted 1,200 employees to half-time work in January,\nwith the expectation that the slowdown will continue for\n12 weeks. See the Vestas press release at:\n<http://www.vestas.com/nyheder/presse/2002/UK/fond20020124_UK.html>.\n\nThe budget also includes a tax credit for the average\nAmerican -- people that install solar hot water or solar\nelectric systems on their homes would earn a tax credit of\n15 percent of the cost of the systems, including installation.\nThe credit has a maximum of $2,000 per person for solar hot\nwater systems and another $2,000 per person for solar\nphotovoltaic systems.\n\nPeople buying hybrid electric vehicles would also earn a tax\ncredit of up to $4,000, with the amount determined by both\nthe performance of the hybrid system and the vehicle's fuel\neconomy. When fuel-cell vehicles become available, they'll\nearn an even higher tax credit -- at least $4,000 and up to\n$8,000, depending on the vehicle's fuel economy.\n\nAnd fuel producers don't get left out of the equation -- the\nbudget also proposes extending the tax credit and excise tax\nexemption for ethanol and methanol from renewable\nsources.\n\nSee pages 71-73, 80 and 99 (PDF pages 75-77, 84 and 103)\nof the \"Analytical Perspectives\" section of the President's\nbudget at:\n<http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2003/>.\n\n\nAlliant Energy Seeks Renewable Power Sources for Iowa\n\nAlliant Energy announced in late January that it plans to add\nenough renewable energy generating capacity in Iowa to\nproduce up to 150,000 megawatt-hours of electricity per year\n-- enough to meet the annual power needs of more than\n20,000 households. A wind power plant that produces power\none-third of the time would require a capacity of about\n50 megawatts to generate that much electricity. The\ncompany serves 464,000 electric customers in Iowa, and\nintends to add the renewable power capacity by the end of\n2003. The company has posted a request for proposals on\nits Web site; proposals are due by April 2nd. See the Alliant\nEnergy press release, with a link to the request for\nproposals, at:\n<http://www.alliantenergy.com/news/news.php?issueID=237>.\n\n\nDOE Awards More Than $500,000 for Metal Casting Research\n\nDOE announced last week its award of $533,328 over three\nyears to a technical consortium, headed by the University of\nMichigan in Ann Arbor, for research into ways to improve the\ncasting of light metal alloys. By studying how heat is\ntransferred between the mold casting and the metal, the\nresearchers hope to develop lighter, stronger, and less-\nexpensive molds. One aim of the research is to reduce the\namount of scrap and reworked materials in the aluminum\nmold and die casting industry by eight percent. The\nprojected energy benefits in the metal casting industry alone\nover the next ten years are estimated to be 36.6 trillion Btu\n-- enough energy to power all the homes in Arkansas for a\nyear. See the DOE press release at:\n<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases02/febpr/pr02015.htm>.\n\n\nExplosion at FuelCell Energy Plant Delays Shipments\n\nAn explosion racked the production line of FuelCell Energy's\nmanufacturing plant in Torrington, Connecticut, on January 14th,\nslightly injured five employees. A buildup of solvent fumes\ncaused the explosion on the company's new \"tape casting\"\nline, which is used to manufacture fuel cell components. The\ncompany emphasized that the explosion was not caused by\nhydrogen, nor was it caused by the operation of one of its\nfuel cells.\n\nFuelCell Energy has continued to assemble fuel cells at the\nfacility since the explosion, but is expecting delays of four to\nsix weeks in its fuel cell shipments. The company shut down\nboth tape-casting lines as a safety precaution, but expects to\nrestart the older line in mid-February. The new tape-casting\nline was recently installed at a cost of $1.7 million. See\nFuelCell Energy's Form 8-K filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (used to make investors aware of\nany significant company events) on the company's Web site at:\n<http://www.fce.com/site/investor/press/releases/2002/01_31_02.html>.\n\n\nNew Energy Corporation Retracts Claim of Solar Contract\n\nNew Energy Corporation announced last week that it had\nmistakenly claimed to have a contract to deliver solar\nelectricity to Teixeira Farms of Santa Maria, California, and\nthat in fact no such contract exists. The company now claims\nto have purchase orders from Distributed Power Systems for\nthe installation of four solar electric systems, each with a\ngenerating capacity of one megawatt. The original story was\ncovered in the January 9th edition of the EREN Network\nNews:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2002/jan09_02.html>.\n\nSince January 18th, the trading of New Energy stock has\nbeen suspended by the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission over \"questions involving the adequacy and\naccuracy of public disclosures,\" in particular, \"the value of\ncertain power generation contracts, the existence and size of\ncertain purchase orders for solar chips and its partner's\nrelationship with the Los Angeles Department of Water and\nPower.\" Last week, Stratos Research, LLC, an investment\nresearch firm, announced that it had suspended coverage of\nNew Energy and had removed its research report on the\ncompany from its Web site, due to concerns that the report\n\"may contain factual errors.\" See all of the relevant press\nreleases by selecting \"Press Release\" on the New Energy\nWeb site at: <http://www.newenergyco.com/>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nENERGY FACTS AND TIPS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nEIA Issues U.S. Renewable Energy Maps\n\nDOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA) completed a\nnew regional series of renewable energy maps last week.\nThe Renewable Energy Map series includes maps of each of\nthe nine U.S. census divisions, plus individual maps of\nCalifornia, Alaska, and Hawaii.

See the\nnews about last year's proposed budget in the April 11,\n2001, edition of the EREN Network News at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2001/apr11_01.html>.\n\n\nBudget Includes Tax Incentives for Renewables, CHP, Hybrids\n\nThe President's budget for fiscal year 2002 includes\n$9.1 billion in tax incentives over 10 years to encourage the\nuse of renewable energy, combined heat and power (CHP)\nsystems, and energy-efficient vehicles.\n\nFor power producers, the budget includes a new 10-percent\ninvestment tax credit for qualifying CHP systems, an\nextension of the tax credit for landfill methane power plants,\nan extension of the production tax credit (PTC) through\n2005, and an expansion of the PTC to include more biomass\nenergy facilities. The PTC provides renewable power\nproducers with a tax break of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (in\n1992 dollars, adjusted for inflation) and was formerly\napplicable only to electricity produced from wind power,\npoultry waste, and biomass power produced from dedicated\nenergy crops.\n\nThe PTC expired in December, leading to a slowdown in the\nwind energy business. For example, Vestas Wind Systems\nA/S shifted 1,200 employees to half-time work in January,\nwith the expectation that the slowdown will continue for\n12 weeks. See the Vestas press release at:\n<http://www.vestas.com/nyheder/presse/2002/UK/fond20020124_UK.html>.\n\nThe budget also includes a tax credit for the average\nAmerican -- people that install solar hot water or solar\nelectric systems on their homes would earn a tax credit of\n15 percent of the cost of the systems, including installation.\nThe credit has a maximum of $2,000 per person for solar hot\nwater systems and another $2,000 per person for solar\nphotovoltaic systems.\n\nPeople buying hybrid electric vehicles would also earn a tax\ncredit of up to $4,000, with the amount determined by both\nthe performance of the hybrid system and the vehicle's fuel\neconomy. When fuel-cell vehicles become available, they'll\nearn an even higher tax credit -- at least $4,000 and up to\n$8,000, depending on the vehicle's fuel economy.\n\nAnd fuel producers don't get left out of the equation -- the\nbudget also proposes extending the tax credit and excise tax\nexemption for ethanol and methanol from renewable\nsources.\n\nSee pages 71-73, 80 and 99 (PDF pages 75-77, 84 and 103)\nof the \"Analytical Perspectives\" section of the President's\nbudget at:\n<http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2003/>.\n\n\nAlliant Energy Seeks Renewable Power Sources for Iowa\n\nAlliant Energy announced in late January that it plans to add\nenough renewable energy generating capacity in Iowa to\nproduce up to 150,000 megawatt-hours of electricity per year\n-- enough to meet the annual power needs of more than\n20,000 households. A wind power plant that produces power\none-third of the time would require a capacity of about\n50 megawatts to generate that much electricity. The\ncompany serves 464,000 electric customers in Iowa, and\nintends to add the renewable power capacity by the end of\n2003. The company has posted a request for proposals on\nits Web site; proposals are due by April 2nd. See the Alliant\nEnergy press release, with a link to the request for\nproposals, at:\n<http://www.alliantenergy.com/news/news.php?issueID=237>.\n\n\nDOE Awards More Than $500,000 for Metal Casting Research\n\nDOE announced last week its award of $533,328 over three\nyears to a technical consortium, headed by the University of\nMichigan in Ann Arbor, for research into ways to improve the\ncasting of light metal alloys. By studying how heat is\ntransferred between the mold casting and the metal, the\nresearchers hope to develop lighter, stronger, and less-\nexpensive molds. One aim of the research is to reduce the\namount of scrap and reworked materials in the aluminum\nmold and die casting industry by eight percent. The\nprojected energy benefits in the metal casting industry alone\nover the next ten years are estimated to be 36.6 trillion Btu\n-- enough energy to power all the homes in Arkansas for a\nyear. See the DOE press release at:\n<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases02/febpr/pr02015.htm>.\n\n\nExplosion at FuelCell Energy Plant Delays Shipments\n\nAn explosion racked the production line of FuelCell Energy's\nmanufacturing plant in Torrington, Connecticut, on January 14th,\nslightly injured five employees. A buildup of solvent fumes\ncaused the explosion on the company's new \"tape casting\"\nline, which is used to manufacture fuel cell components. The\ncompany emphasized that the explosion was not caused by\nhydrogen, nor was it caused by the operation of one of its\nfuel cells.\n\nFuelCell Energy has continued to assemble fuel cells at the\nfacility since the explosion, but is expecting delays of four to\nsix weeks in its fuel cell shipments. The company shut down\nboth tape-casting lines as a safety precaution, but expects to\nrestart the older line in mid-February. The new tape-casting\nline was recently installed at a cost of $1.7 million. See\nFuelCell Energy's Form 8-K filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (used to make investors aware of\nany significant company events) on the company's Web site at:\n<http://www.fce.com/site/investor/press/releases/2002/01_31_02.html>.\n\n\nNew Energy Corporation Retracts Claim of Solar Contract\n\nNew Energy Corporation announced last week that it had\nmistakenly claimed to have a contract to deliver solar\nelectricity to Teixeira Farms of Santa Maria, California, and\nthat in fact no such contract exists. The company now claims\nto have purchase orders from Distributed Power Systems for\nthe installation of four solar electric systems, each with a\ngenerating capacity of one megawatt. The original story was\ncovered in the January 9th edition of the EREN Network\nNews:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2002/jan09_02.html>.\n\nSince January 18th, the trading of New Energy stock has\nbeen suspended by the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission over \"questions involving the adequacy and\naccuracy of public disclosures,\" in particular, \"the value of\ncertain power generation contracts, the existence and size of\ncertain purchase orders for solar chips and its partner's\nrelationship with the Los Angeles Department of Water and\nPower.\" Last week, Stratos Research, LLC, an investment\nresearch firm, announced that it had suspended coverage of\nNew Energy and had removed its research report on the\ncompany from its Web site, due to concerns that the report\n\"may contain factual errors.\" See all of the relevant press\nreleases by selecting \"Press Release\" on the New Energy\nWeb site at: <http://www.newenergyco.com/>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nENERGY FACTS AND TIPS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nEIA Issues U.S. Renewable Energy Maps\n\nDOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA) completed a\nnew regional series of renewable energy maps last week.\nThe Renewable Energy Map series includes maps of each of\nthe nine U.S. census divisions, plus individual maps of\nCalifornia, Alaska, and Hawaii. The maps attempt to indicate\nall renewable energy resources in each region, and also\nshow the location of all renewable energy power plants with\na net summer capacity of 1 megawatt or more.

The President's budget\nproposal for fiscal year 2003 will include $350,000 for the\nBureau of Land Management to improve access for\ngeothermal energy leasing in California, Nevada, Utah,\nOregon, and New Mexico. The budget will also include\n$500,000 for the U.S. Geological Survey to produce\nimproved and updated information on geothermal resources.\nSee the Department of Interior press release at:\n<http://www.doi.gov/news/020118a.html>.\n\nSecretary Norton's announcement came as a follow-up to\nthe \"National Conference on Opportunities to Expand\nRenewable Energy on Public Lands,\" co-hosted by DOE and\nthe Interior Department in November of last year. See the\nDecember 5th edition of the EREN Network News at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2001/dec05_01.html>.\n\nFurther details of President Bush's budget proposal were\nanticipated in last night's State of the Union Address, but the\ntext of the speech was not available at press time. The\nPresident is also expected to release his full budget proposal\nnext week. Watch for further news of the President's budget\nin future editions of the EREN Network News.\n\n\nLarge Wind Power Plant Under Evaluation for Nantucket Sound\n\nCape Wind Associates, LLC is currently proposing to build a\n420-megawatt wind power plant in the waters offshore of\nMassachusetts. If built, the facility will be the first offshore\nwind facility in the United States and the largest U.S. wind\npower plant yet. The company plans to erect 170 turbines in\na part of Nantucket Sound called Horseshoe Shoal. A\nsubmarine cable system consisting of two power lines, each\n115 kilovolts, will transmit the power from the facility to the\nshore at Yarmouth, Massachusetts.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced on Monday\nthat it will require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)\nfor the facility, which will be built on state and federal waters\nstretching across about 28 square miles of the sound. The\nsite is closest to land at Point Gammond, which is 4.1 miles\naway. The Corps will work closely with the Commonwealth\nof Massachusetts, which is also performing an environmental\nreview. On March 6th and 7th, the Corps will hold public\nmeetings to help determine the range of issues the EIS\nshould address and to identify significant issues that should\nbe analyzed in depth. See the press release on the Corps'\nNew England District Web site at:\n<http://www.nae.usace.army.mil/news/2002-16.html>.\n\nCape Wind expects to begin construction on the facility in\n2004 and complete it by 2005. See the Cape Wind Web site\nat: <http://www.capewind.org/learning/pglan02.htm>.\n\nThe Web site also includes a map of the site with overlays of\nshipping channels, ferry routes, and airplane flight lanes, as\nwell as a link to computer-simulated views of the site from\nthe shore, at:\n<http://www.capewind.org/benefiting/sitev02.htm>.\n\nPennsylvania also hopes to increase its wind power\ncapacity: the state's Department of Environmental Protection\n(DEP) issued a permit for a new 60-megawatt wind facility in\nWayne County last week. National Wind Power and Orion\nEnergy LLC are developing the project, which will consist of\n47 turbines on two parcels of land covering 858 acres. See\nthe DEP press release at:\n<http://www.dep.state.pa.us/newsreleases/default.asp?ID=1468>.\n\n\nAcquisitions a Growing Trend in Solar and Wind Power\n\nWhile wind power developers are at work in Massachusetts\nand Pennsylvania, acquisitions appear to be growing in\npopularity as a way to obtain wind power capacity. For\nexample, Entergy Corporation, a global energy company,\nannounced in mid-month its purchase of a majority\nownership in the newly completed Top of Iowa Wind Farm,\nan 80-megawatt facility in northern Iowa. See the Entergy\npress release at:\n<http://www.entergy.com/news_database/news-detail.asp?ID=306>.\n\nShell WindEnergy Inc. followed suit shortly thereafter with its\npurchase of the 80-megawatt Llano Estacando Wind Ranch\nnear Amarillo, Texas, from Cielo Wind Power, LLC. Shell\nWindEnergy is part of Shell Renewables, one of five core\nbusinesses of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies.\n\nBut for Shell Renewables, the big news last week was its\nbuyout of solar photovoltaic partners Siemens AG and E. ON\nEnergie AG. Their joint venture, called Siemens und Shell\nSolar, will now be owned entirely by Shell and will be known\nas Shell Solar.\n\nThe wind and solar purchases are part of the Shell Group's\nplan to invest up to $1 billion in renewable energy\ntechnologies over the next five years. See the Shell\nRenewables press releases at:\n<http://www2.shell.com/home/Framework?siteId=rw-br>.\n\n\nHawaii Resort Dedicates 250-Kilowatt Solar Power System\n\nThe Mauni Lani Resort on the Big Island of Hawaii dedicated\nits new 250-kilowatt solar photovoltaic system last week. The\nsun-tracking system was manufactured and installed by\nPowerLight Corporation. The installation brings the resort's\ntotal solar power capacity to 500 kilowatts, which PowerLight\nclaims as the most solar electric generating capacity of any\nresort in the world. The resort projects savings of $5 million\nover the next 25 years by using solar power. See the\nPowerLight press release at:\n<http://www.powerlight.com/pr/012202powertracker.html>.\n\nPart of the resort's solar generating capacity is actually on\nthe move -- it's a fleet of solar-powered golf carts. A\nphotovoltaic canopy on each cart helps keep its battery\ncharged, significantly reducing the resort's use of grid power\nto recharge the carts. PowerLight just delivered 60 of the\ncarts to the resort, which plans to convert its entire fleet to\nsolar power by the end of 2003. See the PowerLight press\nrelease at:\n<http://www.powerlight.com/pr/012202suncaddy.html>.\n\nThe demand for solar power systems grew significantly in\n2001. At California's Sacramento Municipal Utility District\n(SMUD), for example, nearly 1,200 kilowatts of solar\ngenerating capacity was installed on more than 220 homes\nand business in 2001 -- nearly seven times more than the\nutility installed in 2000. That growth spurt helped SMUD to\nachieve a total solar capacity of 10 megawatts, spread over\nmore than 1,000 solar power systems that were installed\nthrough the utility's Solar Pioneers program. SMUD expects\nthe program to continue growing rapidly in 2002; to meet the\ndemand, the utility has tripled the number of staff and\ncontractors working on the program. See the SMUD press\nrelease at:\n<http://www.smud.org/info/02archive/0118_solar_landmark.html>.\n\n\nNew Zero-Emission Vehicle Rules On Hold in California\n\nCalifornia's latest set of rules for Zero-Emission Vehicles\n(ZEVs), issued by the state's Air Resources Board (ARB),\nhave failed to win approval from the California Office of\nAdministrative Law. The ARB announced last week that the\nrules were apparently not approved because it failed to\nfollow proper procedures when giving notice of its proposed\nchanges to the program. ARB has 120 days to remedy the\nsituation, and it expects to meet that deadline. See the\nnotice on the ARB Web site at:\n<http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/zev2001/zev2001.htm>.\n\nNew York, meanwhile, is pressing ahead with its own\nversion of the ZEV program. The state's current regulations\nrequire ten percent of all vehicles sold in the state to be\nZEVs, which in practical terms means electric vehicles,\nstarting with Model Year 2005. Early this month, Governor\nGeorge E. Pataki announced an alternative approach for\nautomakers that starts a year earlier but includes credits for\nvehicles with near-zero emissions -- vehicles referred to as\nPartial ZEVs or PZEVs in the California rules. The new\napproach also allows partial credits for PZEVs that use\nalternative fuels or hybrid technologies. These changes are\nsimilar to changes made in California by the ARB, but on a\nslower timetable. See Governor Pataki's press release at:\n<http://www.state.ny.us/governor/press/year02/jan4_02.htm>.\n\nState standards for auto emissions are governed by unusual\nrules: by federal law, only California can set stricter standards\nthan the federal standards, and other states must either\nfollow federal standards or adopt standards essentially equal\nto California's. This approach helps keep the standards\nmanageable for automakers, but places California in a\nleadership position. New York, Massachusetts, and Vermont\nhave followed California's lead on ZEV rules. Reportedly,\nMassachusetts is now taking an approach similar to New York's,\nand Vermont has not yet announced what approach it will take.\n\n\nDOE Awards $8 Million for Weatherization in Texas, Oklahoma\n\nDOE announced last week its award of $8 million to Texas\nand Oklahoma for weatherization assistance to low-income\nhouseholds. DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program\nprovides funds to state and local agencies, as well as Native\nAmerican tribes, for measures that improve the energy\nefficiency of the homes of people that can least afford to\nwaste energy. The program provides comprehensive energy\nauditing, health and safety diagnostic services, and whole-\nhouse energy efficiency services, including air infiltration\nreduction, insulation, heating system service, and measures\nto reduce residents' use of electricity. See the DOE press\nrelease at:\n<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases02/janpr/pr02010.htm>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nENERGY FACTS AND TIPS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n2001 Ranked as Second Warmest Year on Record\n\nThe year 2001 was the second warmest globally since\nrecord keeping began in 1880, according to data released in\nmid-January by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA). Only 1998 ranked higher, and\ntemperatures that year were boosted by strong El Nino\nconditions. In contrast, 2001 began with weak La Nina\nconditions, which tend to depress global average\ntemperatures. Temperatures in the United States were also\nabove average; the year ranked as the sixth warmest since\nrecord keeping began in 1895. See the report on NOAA's\nNational Climatic Data Center Web site at:\n<http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2001/ann/ann.html>.\n\nConditions appear ripe for 2002 to become a record-\nbreaking year: according to NOAA's Climate Prediction\nCenter, the tropical Pacific Ocean is warming, a trend which\ncould lead to an El Nino by early Spring. However, NOAA\ncautions that it is too early to predict the magnitude or\nduration of the anticipated El Nino. See the NOAA press\nrelease at:\n<http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s849.htm>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nABOUT THIS NEWSLETTER\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can subscribe to this newsletter using the online form at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/subscribe/>.\nThis Web page also allows you to update your email address\nor unsubscribe to this newsletter.\n\nThe Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Network (EREN)\nhome page is located at <http://www.eren.doe.gov/>.\n\nIf you have questions or comments about this\nnewsletter, please contact the editor, Kevin Eber, at\nkevin_eber@nrel.gov.","content":"\n=================================================\nEREN NETWORK NEWS -- January 30, 2002\nA weekly newsletter from the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Network (EREN).\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/>\n=================================================\n\nFeaturing:\n*News and Events\n          Interior Department Budget to Boost Geothermal Energy\n          Large Wind Power Plant Under Evaluation for Nantucket Sound\n          Acquisitions a Growing Trend in Solar and Wind Power\n          Hawaii Resort Dedicates 250-Kilowatt Solar Power System\n          New Zero-Emission Vehicle Rules On Hold in California\n          DOE Awards $8 Million for Weatherization in Texas, Oklahoma\n\n*Energy Facts and Tips\n          2001 Ranked as Second Warmest Year on Record\n\n*About this Newsletter\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nNEWS AND EVENTS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nInterior Department Budget to Boost Geothermal Energy\n\nSecretary of the Interior Gale Norton announced in mid-\nJanuary that the Interior Department's proposed budget for\nnext year will include funds to encourage geothermal energy\ndevelopment on public lands.

The installation brings the resort's\ntotal solar power capacity to 500 kilowatts, which PowerLight\nclaims as the most solar electric generating capacity of any\nresort in the world. The resort projects savings of $5 million\nover the next 25 years by using solar power. See the\nPowerLight press release at:\n<http://www.powerlight.com/pr/012202powertracker.html>.\n\nPart of the resort's solar generating capacity is actually on\nthe move -- it's a fleet of solar-powered golf carts. A\nphotovoltaic canopy on each cart helps keep its battery\ncharged, significantly reducing the resort's use of grid power\nto recharge the carts. PowerLight just delivered 60 of the\ncarts to the resort, which plans to convert its entire fleet to\nsolar power by the end of 2003. See the PowerLight press\nrelease at:\n<http://www.powerlight.com/pr/012202suncaddy.html>.\n\nThe demand for solar power systems grew significantly in\n2001. At California's Sacramento Municipal Utility District\n(SMUD), for example, nearly 1,200 kilowatts of solar\ngenerating capacity was installed on more than 220 homes\nand business in 2001 -- nearly seven times more than the\nutility installed in 2000. That growth spurt helped SMUD to\nachieve a total solar capacity of 10 megawatts, spread over\nmore than 1,000 solar power systems that were installed\nthrough the utility's Solar Pioneers program. SMUD expects\nthe program to continue growing rapidly in 2002; to meet the\ndemand, the utility has tripled the number of staff and\ncontractors working on the program. See the SMUD press\nrelease at:\n<http://www.smud.org/info/02archive/0118_solar_landmark.html>.\n\n\nNew Zero-Emission Vehicle Rules On Hold in California\n\nCalifornia's latest set of rules for Zero-Emission Vehicles\n(ZEVs), issued by the state's Air Resources Board (ARB),\nhave failed to win approval from the California Office of\nAdministrative Law. The ARB announced last week that the\nrules were apparently not approved because it failed to\nfollow proper procedures when giving notice of its proposed\nchanges to the program. ARB has 120 days to remedy the\nsituation, and it expects to meet that deadline. See the\nnotice on the ARB Web site at:\n<http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/zev2001/zev2001.htm>.\n\nNew York, meanwhile, is pressing ahead with its own\nversion of the ZEV program. The state's current regulations\nrequire ten percent of all vehicles sold in the state to be\nZEVs, which in practical terms means electric vehicles,\nstarting with Model Year 2005. Early this month, Governor\nGeorge E. Pataki announced an alternative approach for\nautomakers that starts a year earlier but includes credits for\nvehicles with near-zero emissions -- vehicles referred to as\nPartial ZEVs or PZEVs in the California rules. The new\napproach also allows partial credits for PZEVs that use\nalternative fuels or hybrid technologies. These changes are\nsimilar to changes made in California by the ARB, but on a\nslower timetable. See Governor Pataki's press release at:\n<http://www.state.ny.us/governor/press/year02/jan4_02.htm>.\n\nState standards for auto emissions are governed by unusual\nrules: by federal law, only California can set stricter standards\nthan the federal standards, and other states must either\nfollow federal standards or adopt standards essentially equal\nto California's. This approach helps keep the standards\nmanageable for automakers, but places California in a\nleadership position. New York, Massachusetts, and Vermont\nhave followed California's lead on ZEV rules. Reportedly,\nMassachusetts is now taking an approach similar to New York's,\nand Vermont has not yet announced what approach it will take.\n\n\nDOE Awards $8 Million for Weatherization in Texas, Oklahoma\n\nDOE announced last week its award of $8 million to Texas\nand Oklahoma for weatherization assistance to low-income\nhouseholds. DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program\nprovides funds to state and local agencies, as well as Native\nAmerican tribes, for measures that improve the energy\nefficiency of the homes of people that can least afford to\nwaste energy. The program provides comprehensive energy\nauditing, health and safety diagnostic services, and whole-\nhouse energy efficiency services, including air infiltration\nreduction, insulation, heating system service, and measures\nto reduce residents' use of electricity. See the DOE press\nrelease at:\n<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases02/janpr/pr02010.htm>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nENERGY FACTS AND TIPS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n2001 Ranked as Second Warmest Year on Record\n\nThe year 2001 was the second warmest globally since\nrecord keeping began in 1880, according to data released in\nmid-January by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA). Only 1998 ranked higher, and\ntemperatures that year were boosted by strong El Nino\nconditions. In contrast, 2001 began with weak La Nina\nconditions, which tend to depress global average\ntemperatures. Temperatures in the United States were also\nabove average; the year ranked as the sixth warmest since\nrecord keeping began in 1895. See the report on NOAA's\nNational Climatic Data Center Web site at:\n<http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2001/ann/ann.html>.\n\nConditions appear ripe for 2002 to become a record-\nbreaking year: according to NOAA's Climate Prediction\nCenter, the tropical Pacific Ocean is warming, a trend which\ncould lead to an El Nino by early Spring. However, NOAA\ncautions that it is too early to predict the magnitude or\nduration of the anticipated El Nino. See the NOAA press\nrelease at:\n<http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s849.htm>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nABOUT THIS NEWSLETTER\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can subscribe to this newsletter using the online form at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/subscribe/>.\nThis Web page also allows you to update your email address\nor unsubscribe to this newsletter.\n\nThe Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Network (EREN)\nhome page is located at <http://www.eren.doe.gov/>.\n\nIf you have questions or comments about this\nnewsletter, please contact the editor, Kevin Eber, at\nkevin_eber@nrel.gov.","messageId":"<14819091.1075860998508.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2002-01-30T05:30:22+05:30","from":"keber@mail.nrel.gov","subject":"EREN Network News -- 01/30/02","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"EREN <keber@mail.nrel.gov>","xTo":"eren@mail.nrel.gov","xFolder":"\\Richard_Ring_Mar2002\\Ring, Richard\\EESI_Deleted_Documents","xOrigin":"Ring-R","xFileName":"rring (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"eren@mail.nrel.gov"}

{"rawContent":"\n\n                       ZE Power Group Inc.\n.................................................................\n\n                          ENERGY VIEWS\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n           Changing Perspectives on the Energy Industry\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n           CUT BACKS IN 2002: BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT\n                  OR JUST PLAIN BUSINESS RISK?\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nTHE BIG BANG IN 2001\n\n2001 was a year like no other. The magnitude of events and \neconomic repercussions, have been difficult to manage for many. \nWe, as industry participants, have witnessed tremendous \nuncertainty and price volatility, which resulted in stratospheric \nprice increases and the collapse of energy markets. As markets \ndied (actually returned to historical lows) and as industry \nparticipants filed for bankruptcy, we are left with the question \n\"What next?\".\n\nINDUSTRY IN FLUX\n\nThe industry is in a state of flux once again and floundering \nbadly. The California experiment and the Enron model proved to be \neconomic disasters that may never be rivaled. After the fallout, \nwho is left to blame? Do we scapegoat it to the California \nregulators, to those eager to make a buck or to an overriding \nfailure of all us to recognize the complexity and unique nature \nof the energy industry.\n\nCUTBACKS AND LAY-OFFS\n\nThe worrisome reaction of many industry participants (coast to \ncoast), at this time, has been to dramatically cut capital \nspending and reduce staff. This may seem a safe option given the \nrelative calm of energy prices, in our opinion this strategy may \nbe suspect in the long-term. The forthcoming changes from \nregulators, and from within the industry itself, will be massive \nand will require significant resources to implement.\n\nWill you be ready for the onslaught? Business protocol must \nchange and that change will be all encompassing. US Federal \nReserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, expressed confidence that there \nwould be significant changes to accounting practices and \ncorporate governance (of the energy industry) as a result of the \nEnron/Anderson scandal.\n\nTHE CERTAINTY OF CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY\n\nIf we have learned anything in the last six years, since the \nopening of the Alberta Power Pool on January 1 1996, it is that \nthe market is violently uncertain. There is no indication that \nthe industry will stabilize any time soon. The other not so \nobvious observation is that those corporations operating in \ncompetitive markets with solid infrastructure, effective trade \nand risk policy and the ability to intelligently analyze large \namounts of data have come into 2002 in relatively good shape. The \nindustry as it is currently situated suggests a need for some \nlevel of conservatism without compromising corporate integrity. \nPerhaps now is not the time to cutback, but rather to shore-up \nwhile there is a break in the storm.\n\nHOW ARE YOU POSITIONED\n\nWhat corporations should be asking is how actions I am taking \ntoday will impact tomorrow's business opportunities. We know many \nare cutting back on expenditures, but is this at the cost of risk \nexposure or lost opportunity. There is limited risk as long as \nprices are low; but we all know that the industry has thus far \nbehaved outside of anybody's expectations. There is no reason why \nuncertainty will not continue to prevail.\n\nZE POWERGROUP CAN HELP\n\nWe have spent the better part of the last six years working \ndiligently to equip our clients with nimbleness in and protection \nfrom volatile energy markets. As such, we moved from providing \nhigh-level strategic support for our clients to developing the \nsoftware tools required for dynamic trade.

{"rawContent":"\n\n                       ZE Power Group Inc.\n.................................................................\n\n                          ENERGY VIEWS\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n           Changing Perspectives on the Energy Industry\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                   ARE YOU ACTING PRUDENTLY?\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nThe Energy industry seems to be in a somewhat tenuous state. As\ncredit and accounting standards have come unglued the integrity\nof the biggest players is called into question. Accounting firms\nhave claimed their accounting practices to be \"creative and\naggressive\" while their clients claim that there actions were\n\"not unethical\", with apparent stress on the \"not\" part. One now\nbattered marketer has been specifically accused of \"suspending\nthe rules of corporate ethics and perhaps even put corporate\nmorality on vacation\".\n\nWords like scandal, allegations, suspicions and cover-up have\nbecome rank in the industry. CEOs have been asked to leave their\npositions, executives have been forcibly terminated while another\ncommits suicide; and the investigations continue, including\ncriminal ones. The situation is sobering.\n\nIt seems like these last few years have been full of bubbles\nbursting as we all collectively share a cold bath of economic\nreality. The techs tumbled and the stock markets followed, the\nelectricity market (at least in California) imploded, real bombs\nare exploding all over the place and the mightiest energy\nmarketer has fallen; and it won't be getting back up. The biggest\nbankruptcy in US history will definitely leave its mark on all of\nus. To think, we thought the troubles of PG&E and the Cal-PX was\nbig news.\n\nArthur Levitt, former SEC boss, suggests that \"Enron's collapse\ndid not occur in a vacuum ... (and was) ... was partly a result\nof a culture of gamesmanship among go-go businesses that believe\nit's okay to bend the rules\". This is a fundamental folly of the\nindustry as people with limited energy knowledge (and integrity) \nplay games with other peoples money and not understanding or\ncaring about the consequences. It is not surprising that the\nstock value of other marketers is also beginning to plummet.\n\nSo the question of the day is: are you acting prudently? It is\ninsufficient to assume that might is right or size is protection.\nContracting with the largest does not secure your contract; no\nmore than using the largest accounting firm ensures your books\nare right. We all leave a paper trail and that trail is visible\nin a moonless night during a California forced blackout, even if\nyou order your accounting firm to delete the emails and shred the\n\"evidence\".\n\nIn working with our clients, we have come to see that information\ndoes not receive its due respect. Perhaps it's the fault of the\nInternet and the information overload factor, but not respecting\ninformation is costly. We have witnessed \"lost deals\" and poor\nfollow-up. We have seen the cost of not rigorously following\ncorporate trade, risk credit procedures and surely we have seen\nthe result of blind faith in the big guys. To this end we\nactively support our clients to equip themselves to effectively\nmanage large amounts of market information.\n\nEnergy market participants, more so than perhaps other\nindustries, must heed the requirement for prudence. For many\nprudence is a forgotten tradition from the franchise days.\nPrudence in competitive markets, which all energy markets are to\nsome degree, means a lot more now than it did in the franchise\nera. We are all under the purvey of the public, the investor and\nthe regulators. Not to recognize this fact can have severe\neconomic ramifications. Prudence now means having trade, risk and\ncredit policies and procedures, having the tools to manage and\nanalyze data and foremost, developing the ability to internally\nmake the right judgment calls.\n\nCall us to see how ZE PowerGroup can help your organization to\nmanage its operation in uncertain markets.  For more information\nvisit http://www.ze.com or call Paul Seo at 604-244-1672 or by \nemail mailto:paul@ze.com\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n      Having the Information and Doing Nothing About It\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt seems evident that Anderson, the government and Enron itself,\nhad privy to a lot of financial data that clearly indicated the \neventual collapse of Enron.\n\n*  Andersen contemplated dropping Enron as a client nearly one \n   year ago because of concerns due to Enron's accounting\n   methodology.\n*  The White House oversaw a study in October 2001 of economic\n   repercussions of an    Enron collapse.\n*  Sherron Watkins, a senior Enron Executive, wrote to Enron's\n   chairman, Ken Lay, \"I am incredibly nervous that we will\n   implode in a wave of accounting scandals.\" last August 2001\"\n*  The writing was clearly on the wall but most were unable to\n   react to the intelligence. It    all comes down to the\n   lemming factor; we can see the cliff but just cannot\n   avoid jumping.\n\nMany in the industry suffer badly from the chronic inability to\nreact in a timely manner. This failure often results in severe\nnegative economic impacts. Either policy is not in place to allow\naffirmative reaction or staff does not adhere to the policies\nthat exist.\n\nGood corporate policy is the corner stone of sound market\nparticipation\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n                    About ZE Energy Views\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nIn our continuous efforts to serve the industry, we have\ndeveloped \"Energy Views\" as a platform to communicate with the\nindustry on a regular basis in order to relate issues and views\nwe believe to have industry wide relevance.

The only location where EESO currently delivers physi=\r\ncal commodity is Massachusetts - BECO, which represent approximately fifty =\r\npercent of the total \"Core Load\" or approximately 30 MW's and commenced in =\r\nOctober 2000.\r\n\r\nThe agreement has provided other commodity upsell opportunities such as (i)=\r\n physical delivery of comodity GSA accounts and Coast Guard accounts in Mai=\r\nne behind Central Maine Power (June 2000 thru October 2003)  and (ii) sale =\r\nand delivery of \"renewable energy\" to GSA and Hanscom Air Force Base (Octob=\r\ner 2000 thru December 2001, with opportunity to extend thru October 2003).\r\n\r\nValue Added Services under the agreement has been responsible for (i) solar=\r\n panel project development and installation (ii) cogeneration project devel=\r\nopment and installation (in progress) (iii) chilled water project and (iv) =\r\nmaintenance agreement, all which total additional 50-55 million dollars.  E=\r\nESO had asked GSA to allow the contract to be split between commodity and v=\r\nalue added services and GSA refused. A decision was made that would allow E=\r\nnron Facilities Services (EFS) to perform the value added services portion =\r\nof the contract, on behalf of EESO.  To the best of my knowledge the cogene=\r\nration projects would affect only the Veterans Administration sites, behind=\r\n Massachusetts-BECO only. =20\r\n\r\nThere is another issue that we can discuss at your convenience which relvol=\r\nves around the Master Subcontracting Plan and the requirement, in the last =\r\ntwo years of the agreement for EESO to spend 1 million each year of the las=\r\nt two years of the agreement utilizing small business concerns, small disad=\r\nvantaged business concerns, and women-owned small business concerns.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you would like to discuss any of the above referenced inform=\r\nation.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nRichard     =20\r\n\r\n -----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: =09Herndon, Rogers =20\r\nSent:=09Wednesday, October 03, 2001 8:25 AM\r\nTo:=09Wheeler, Christopher\r\nCc:=09Ring, Richard\r\nSubject:=09RE: GSA Region 1 Projects Transition\r\n\r\nNo acceptance.\r\n\r\nThis is not enough info for me to accept anything.

Pitts, Jr.\r\nThe Miami Herald\r\n\r\nIt's my job to have something to say.\r\n\r\nThey pay me to provide words that help make sense of that which troubles th=\r\ne\r\nAmerican soul. But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting\r\ndisbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the only words that\r\nseem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author of this suffering.\r\n\r\nYou monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard.\r\n\r\nWhat lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's attack on our World\r\nTrade Center, our Pentagon, us? What was it you hoped we would learn?\r\nWhatever it was, please know that you failed.\r\n\r\nDid you want us to respect your cause? You just damned your cause. Did you\r\nwant to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve. Did you want to tear us\r\napart? You just brought us together.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome family, a\r\nfamily rent by racial, social, political and class division, but a family\r\nnonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotiona=\r\nl\r\nenergy on pop cultural minutiae -- a singer's revealing dress, a ball team'=\r\ns\r\nmisfortune, a cartoon mouse. We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready\r\navailability of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of that, we\r\nwalk through life with a certain sense of blithe entitlement. We are\r\nfundamentally decent, though -- peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle\r\nto know the right thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming majority\r\nof us, people of faith, believers in a just and loving God.\r\n\r\nSome people -- you, perhaps -- think that any or all of this makes us weak.\r\nYou're mistaken. We are not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot\r\nbe measured by arsenals.\r\n\r\nIN PAIN\r\nYes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We're still\r\ngrappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still working to\r\nmake ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect from some\r\nHollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot development from a Tom Clancy novel.\r\nBoth in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the probable final\r\ndeath toll, your attacks are likely to go down as the worst acts of\r\nterrorism in the history of the United States and, probably, the history of\r\nthe world. You've bloodied us as we have never been bloodied before.\r\n\r\nBut there's a gulf of difference between making us bloody and making us\r\nfall. This is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter sorrow the last tim=\r\ne\r\nanyone hit us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and\r\nmonumental pain. When roused, we are righteous in our outrage, terrible in\r\nour force. When provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear any\r\nsuffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice.\r\n\r\nI tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you, I\r\nthink, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with\r\ndread of the future.\r\n\r\nIn the days to come, there will be recrimination and accusation, fingers\r\npointing to determine whose failure allowed this to happen  and what can be\r\ndone to prevent it from happening again. There will be heightened security,\r\nmisguided talk of revoking basic freedoms. We'll go forward from this momen=\r\nt\r\nsobered, chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined.\r\n\r\nTHE STEEL IN US\r\nYou see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect of our\r\ncharacter is seldom understood by people who don't know us well. On this\r\nday, the family's bickering is put on hold.\r\n\r\nAs Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we\r\nwill rise in defense of all that we cherish.\r\n\r\nSo I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It occurs to me that\r\nmaybe you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred. If that's the\r\ncase, consider the message received. And take this message in exchange: You\r\ndon't know my people. You don't know what we're capable of. You don't know\r\nwhat you just started.\r\n\r\nBut you're about to learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRFC822 header\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n Return-Path: <rtheimer@davox.com>\r\n Received: from relay2.san.cerf.net (192.215.81.75) by mail.campagne.com wi=\r\nth\r\n  ESMTP (Eudora Internet Mail Server 2.2.2); Thu, 13 Sep 2001 14:01:11 -040=\r\n0\r\n Received: from intra.

I am glad to hear that you are\nwell.\n\nJust to reiterate our earlier conversation of today.\n\nCurrently, under the GSA small business plan submitted by Enron, the\nrequirements state that the commodity delivered outside of the Enron\ndelivery is to go 100% to small business concerns.  Of that 100%, 10%\nneeds to go through a small disadvantaged concern and 5% through a\nwomen-owned.  If A'lones chooses not to get certified for a small\ndisadvantaged business (SDB), Enron will need find a SDB provider as\nwell as a women-owned.\n\nUnder the current situation, there are limited numbers of SDB's or\nwomen-owned businesses who are currently electricity providers; however\nthe Enron supplier diversity program is working to create these\nopportunities and should be rolling out a program 1/2002.  Since the GSA\ncontract's small business plan requirements are cumulative for years 4 &\n5, it doesn't make a difference when we utilize the suppliers as long as\nthe percentages are met and within the appropriate timeframe.  Year 4\njust started this month.\n\nWhat is at risk here for A'lones is at least 10% of the contract and\npotentially 15%.  If they choose not to get certified it will be our\nresponsibility to fulfill our contractual obligations to GSA and find\ncandidates to meet that 15% before the end of year 5.\n\nI will be very happy to work with the A'lones group. I know that they\nhave been working with us for a period of time but they do have to\nunderstood what is at risk if they do not get certified.  Also, lack of\ncertification could jeopardize any potential additional business with\nEnron.  I do know that the A'lones has been told this.\n\nI believe that we can work an arrangement with A'lones where we can\ninitiate the contract if everything has been completed and also have a\nstatement in there that A'lones will do there certification within a\nspecific time period.  Once again as an accumulative contract this\narrangement would work.\n\nIf you have any questions on this, please feel free to give me a call.\n\nJennifer S.

Harris stated\nthat the FERC should be empowered to ensure that every transmission entity in\nthe United States participates in Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) as\nan essential element of a synchronous market, so as to produce consistency,\npromote rational regional planning, relieve congestion and refine pricing.\n\n\"We urge Congress not to create yet another organization to oversee\nreliability,\" Harris said, referring to a proposal by the North American\nElectric Reliability Council.  \"The industry should be looking for ways to\nintegrate its functions into the marketplace, not creating new industry silos.\"\n\nHarris also restated his support for the FERC plan to integrate existing\nwholesale electric markets into four RTOs. The creation of large RTOs under the\nRegional Network Model that PJM proposed for the Northeast will significantly\nenhance the security and continuity of the national grid. Under the PJM Regional\nNetwork Model approach, data and responsibility will be decentralized among\nmultiple paths while, through a hierarchical design, the benefits of integration\nand uniformity are realized.  Harris noted that this approach is far more secure\nthan the system which presently exists where there are silos of security\nresponsibility among each of the individual utilities in much of the country.\n\nIn addition to recommendations on reliability and security issues, Harris\nhighlighted additional ways Congress could support delivering real and\nmeasurable results to electric consumers. These include:\n\n*\tSiting - Congress should provide deference to decisions reached through\nbalanced regional planning processes which are open and which do not favor\ntransmission solutions over generation solutions or one technology over another;\nembracing and enhancing open regional planning processes that involve all\naffected states.\n\n*\tMore standardization of market design - FERC needs to more clearly\ndelineate the exact market functions to be performed by emerging RTOs and ensure\na certain degree of standardization of design so as to promote the free flow of\ninformation to enable commerce of this instantaneous, speed of light product.\nHarris noted that PJM remains concerned that in much of the rest of the country\nthe developing RTOs seem to want to remain passive grid operators with no\nobligation to ensure a vibrant marketplace.\n\n*\tFERC resources - Congress should ensure that the FERC is fully staffed\nand has the resources needed to appropriately monitor the markets and regulate\nin those areas where any market is not properly functioning. Harris noted that\nthis is not the time to pull the rug out of the FERC's efforts to deliver on the\npromise of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and Order 2000.\n\n*\tRole of technology - The nation is moving rapidly to networked\ninformation through advanced technology. The FERC should have these advanced\ntools and the staff resources to use them in order to identify and be responsive\nto market dysfunctions in a timely manner. And even more importantly, Harris\nnoted, in writing laws in the electricity area Congress should provide broad\nauthority to the FERC and other government institutions rather than codifying\nconstraints, which will tie the agency's hands.\n\n\"Our message is simple,\" Harris noted. \"With the wise use of information and\nwith institutions such as the FERC having broad and flexible authority and a\nclear mission to promote competitive markets, our laws and institutions can\nbegin to catch up and operate closer to the speed and efficiency of this\ninstantaneous product - electricity.\"\n\nA complete copy of Harris' comments is available on PJM's Web site at\nwww.pjm.com - under PJM news, current topics.\n\nPJM, the country's only fully functioning regional transmission organization,\noperates the world's largest competitive wholesale electricity market and one of\nNorth America's largest power grids.

{"rawContent":"\nHi Gillian-\nI was about to hit \"send\" on this email to you when your arrived. Pardon me for not reviewing the latest draft, but rather I'm sending you my comments as written.\nThanks-\nMichele\n\n\nRegarding Mike Smith's questions:\n\n1. In that congestion is the differential between the PJM price and the zonal price, congestion is a non-issue for the index product.  We will not bear any congestion costs, and referencing it in the agreement may cause confusion.\n\n2. Regarding the contingency that BGE cease to exist or be renamed I suggest something along the lines of--  \"we shall substitute a comparable zonal price.\"\n\nAfter our previous conversation I discussed this with Richard Ring, and we agree it may be disadvantageous to refer to the \"closest\", or specifically mention the zone where we physically schedule, because it's impossible to foresee what shape these changes may take. And it's certainly better if we can make a reasonable decision as to a substitute zonal price.\n\nMike may want additional language--that you will notify them of the new zone and give them an opportunity to disagree--but all those details are beyond my expertise. \n\nPlease note that this is the one situation where congestion may--but is unlikely to--apply, if the new zone is farther away from the load then before. Let's assume for a moment that it is far more likely that the zone would be broken in to two zones than for it to be eliminated.  Furthermore, specific mention of congestion implies that we will also credit the customer for any negative congestion that may apply, which opens an entirely new matter. Let me know if you want more clarification of this point.\n\n3. The Deficiency Rate is defined in the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement.\n\n4. The Ancillary Services are defined in the Operating Agreement and the OATT, the calculations are defined in the Operating Agreement Accounting and OATT Accounting Manuals (M-28 and M-27), and the rates are posted on the PJM website or otherwise published annually as may apply.\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tJohnson, Gillian  \nSent:\tMonday, October 08, 2001 11:57 AM\nTo:\tRaque, Michele\nCc:\tRing, Richard; Smith, Mike\nSubject:\tMost recent version of TC\n\n\n\n\n\nMichele,\n\nAs we discussed, please address the two issues that Mike discussed in the TC regarding ICAP and ancillaries.\n\nPlease also confirm the following.  You have deleted congestion as one of the pass-through components because it is inherently included in the LMP.  Does it do any harm leaving it in the contract?\n\nIn his last email Mike asked whether or not there was any chance that there could be a difference between the EESI Energy Price as we have defined it and the Spot Energy price.  This would be a critical issue for the site profile desk.  Please confirm that we are taking great pains to describe this in such a way that there would be no delta between the two.\n\nI have included language from Mike regarding the customer's ability to lock in to a fixed price at any point.\n\nLastly, Mike, I agree with your changes related to the transmission issue.  It does appear to be included in the paragraph above.\n\nRelated to Anticipated Usage, Bob and I thought that listing it twice (e.g., we will pay you an amount each month equal to the product of the Anticipated Usage for such month and $0.[    ] per kWh of Anticipated Usage) was redundant but frankly it does no harm to leave it as is.\n\n << File: MD Master confirm DISC-INDEX 10-8 DRAFT DO NOT USE gj.doc >> ","content":"\nHi Gillian-\nI was about to hit \"send\" on this email to you when your arrived.

Regarding the contingency that BGE cease to exist or be renamed I suggest something along the lines of--  \"we shall substitute a comparable zonal price.\"\n\nAfter our previous conversation I discussed this with Richard Ring, and we agree it may be disadvantageous to refer to the \"closest\", or specifically mention the zone where we physically schedule, because it's impossible to foresee what shape these changes may take. And it's certainly better if we can make a reasonable decision as to a substitute zonal price.\n\nMike may want additional language--that you will notify them of the new zone and give them an opportunity to disagree--but all those details are beyond my expertise. \n\nPlease note that this is the one situation where congestion may--but is unlikely to--apply, if the new zone is farther away from the load then before. Let's assume for a moment that it is far more likely that the zone would be broken in to two zones than for it to be eliminated.  Furthermore, specific mention of congestion implies that we will also credit the customer for any negative congestion that may apply, which opens an entirely new matter. Let me know if you want more clarification of this point.\n\n3. The Deficiency Rate is defined in the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement.\n\n4. The Ancillary Services are defined in the Operating Agreement and the OATT, the calculations are defined in the Operating Agreement Accounting and OATT Accounting Manuals (M-28 and M-27), and the rates are posted on the PJM website or otherwise published annually as may apply.\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tJohnson, Gillian  \nSent:\tMonday, October 08, 2001 11:57 AM\nTo:\tRaque, Michele\nCc:\tRing, Richard; Smith, Mike\nSubject:\tMost recent version of TC\n\n\n\n\n\nMichele,\n\nAs we discussed, please address the two issues that Mike discussed in the TC regarding ICAP and ancillaries.\n\nPlease also confirm the following.

I appreciate all the work you guys are doing and =\r\nfeel as though we're really gaining some traction.\r\n\r\nGreen Power Market Development Group -- We will be submitting a proposal to=\r\n the Wind Energy Working Group of the Green Power Market Development Group =\r\n(headed by Mark Crowdis of Think Energy) on Tuesday with a variety of prici=\r\nng proposals for products ranging from physical commodity with green tags t=\r\no green tags with embedded call options. Richard and I are working together=\r\n to develop pricing for tags in the Pac Northwest, California, Texas and th=\r\ne East. I feel good about our chances of getting something done with these =\r\nguys as they are feeling the heat to do something concrete after making so =\r\nmany public declarations of intent. As we move forward, I think we should a=\r\nll do a lot of thinking about other companies we should approach for this t=\r\nype of product. Once the Enron Building is juiced with wind power, we will =\r\nbe able to approach other fortune 500 companies with a straight face and en=\r\ncourage them to become Green Power Alliance Customers. During the week of S=\r\neptember 11, I plan to be in Houston to work extensively on drawing up the =\r\nguidelines for the Alliance Program and working more closely with Richard a=\r\nnd Stacey and their EES contacts to develop green power products for up-str=\r\neam marketing and new origination efforts.\r\nElliot meeting with Wind Subc on Thursday 9/20 at 8:00 a.m.\r\nBeldon and Herndon are renewable products - get product descriptions to bot=\r\nh.\r\n=09One page description of renewable energy product\r\n=09RE + EE - Energy Audit\r\n\r\nLos Angeles Department of Water and Power -- LADWP is the largest green pow=\r\ner buyer among public power agencies in California. Their green power buyer=\r\n is heavily understaffed (and somewhat outgunned in terms of industry knowl=\r\nedge). He has hired us to help him bring his contract negotiations to fruit=\r\nion, manage logistics for new projects and essentially sleeve new renewable=\r\n power products through Enron's existing Master Services Agreement with LAD=\r\nWP. This is an exciting (although not very profitable at this point) opport=\r\nunity to establish the nodes of the California Renewable Power Pool and we =\r\nsee this as a way to bring our Services Desk functions to bear on the renew=\r\nable sector in California. I am meeting with FPL Energy next week to discus=\r\ns becoming the logistics coordinator for their new wind projects in Califor=\r\nnia.\r\nLADWP=20\r\n=09unresponsive at present\r\n=09volumes can be doubled under current contract ($13 on tags)\r\n=09Contractual consulting potential - manage purchase of hydro=20\r\nEEI language meeting resistance due to the force majeur language etc.\r\n\r\nWind Development -- As you may know, I purchased an option on a large parce=\r\nl of windy land in Central Washington with enXco, a wind development concer=\r\nn. We are marketing the project to two of the munis in the Pacific Northwes=\r\nt (Seattle City Light and Eugene Water and Electric Board). Both have expre=\r\nssed interest. This morning I am meeting with the City of Portland to try t=\r\no convince Portland to follow Seattle's lead as a zero-carbon growth city a=\r\nnd signatory to the type of Kyotoesque committments recently announced by N=\r\new England legislators.\r\nLeave that to Enron Wind, etc.\r\nUpside limited compared to time spent\r\nConcentrate on niche - marketing/services and downstream sales.\r\nEOL? - Need a more liquid market - more demand\r\nRenewable Portfolio Standard -- The proposed CA RPS has major implications =\r\nfor our business, from both a risk management and commercial opportunity pe=\r\nrspective. We need to really drill down on this today and get as much insig=\r\nht as to the political climate as possible. Having witnessed the first meet=\r\ning of the California Power Authority last Friday in Sacramento, I am perso=\r\nnally convinced that the RPS will definitely be passed in some shape or for=\r\nm. If they pass a 1% requirement for new renewables next year, this transla=\r\ntes into 430MWm off a 43,000MW peak load in CA. We have very good working r=\r\nelationships with several of the biomass generators in California, includin=\r\ng generators with new resources, and we are actively negotiating a marketin=\r\ng agreement with one of them and considering taking a long position for the=\r\n next couple of years. The critical question, of course, is who will actual=\r\nly have the short position in California? If it is just the DWR, then they =\r\nwill probably satisfy their requirement with their new renewables purchases=\r\n. If the utilities end up serving load, they will be in the market looking =\r\nfor the least-cost resources, and new biomass will clearly be a part of the=\r\n mix.\r\nnational RPS - follow up with John Shelk\r\nStir up demand\r\nPac Northwest RFPs -- Both PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric have RF=\r\nPs out right now for green tags and retail marketing services. I am staying=\r\n in touch with Bonneville Environmental Foundation, Green Mountain Energy a=\r\nnd Community Energy to act as a wholesaler for their tag submissions. I wan=\r\nt to get master services contracts in place with each of these entities to =\r\nmake it really easy for them to transact with us.

I appreciate all the work you guys are doing and =\r\nfeel as though we're really gaining some traction.\r\n\r\nGreen Power Market Development Group -- We will be submitting a proposal to=\r\n the Wind Energy Working Group of the Green Power Market Development Group =\r\n(headed by Mark Crowdis of Think Energy) on Tuesday with a variety of prici=\r\nng proposals for products ranging from physical commodity with green tags t=\r\no green tags with embedded call options. Richard and I are working together=\r\n to develop pricing for tags in the Pac Northwest, California, Texas and th=\r\ne East. I feel good about our chances of getting something done with these =\r\nguys as they are feeling the heat to do something concrete after making so =\r\nmany public declarations of intent. As we move forward, I think we should a=\r\nll do a lot of thinking about other companies we should approach for this t=\r\nype of product. Once the Enron Building is juiced with wind power, we will =\r\nbe able to approach other fortune 500 companies with a straight face and en=\r\ncourage them to become Green Power Alliance Customers. During the week of S=\r\neptember 11, I plan to be in Houston to work extensively on drawing up the =\r\nguidelines for the Alliance Program and working more closely with Richard a=\r\nnd Stacey and their EES contacts to develop green power products for up-str=\r\neam marketing and new origination efforts.\r\nElliot meeting with Wind Subc on Thursday 9/20 at 8:00 a.m.\r\nBeldon and Herndon are renewable products - get product descriptions to bot=\r\nh.\r\n=09One page description of renewable energy product\r\n=09RE + EE - Energy Audit\r\n\r\nLos Angeles Department of Water and Power -- LADWP is the largest green pow=\r\ner buyer among public power agencies in California. Their green power buyer=\r\n is heavily understaffed (and somewhat outgunned in terms of industry knowl=\r\nedge). He has hired us to help him bring his contract negotiations to fruit=\r\nion, manage logistics for new projects and essentially sleeve new renewable=\r\n power products through Enron's existing Master Services Agreement with LAD=\r\nWP. This is an exciting (although not very profitable at this point) opport=\r\nunity to establish the nodes of the California Renewable Power Pool and we =\r\nsee this as a way to bring our Services Desk functions to bear on the renew=\r\nable sector in California. I am meeting with FPL Energy next week to discus=\r\ns becoming the logistics coordinator for their new wind projects in Califor=\r\nnia.\r\nLADWP=20\r\n=09unresponsive at present\r\n=09volumes can be doubled under current contract ($13 on tags)\r\n=09Contractual consulting potential - manage purchase of hydro=20\r\nEEI language meeting resistance due to the force majeur language etc.\r\n\r\nWind Development -- As you may know, I purchased an option on a large parce=\r\nl of windy land in Central Washington with enXco, a wind development concer=\r\nn. We are marketing the project to two of the munis in the Pacific Northwes=\r\nt (Seattle City Light and Eugene Water and Electric Board). Both have expre=\r\nssed interest. This morning I am meeting with the City of Portland to try t=\r\no convince Portland to follow Seattle's lead as a zero-carbon growth city a=\r\nnd signatory to the type of Kyotoesque committments recently announced by N=\r\new England legislators.\r\nLeave that to Enron Wind, etc.\r\nUpside limited compared to time spent\r\nConcentrate on niche - marketing/services and downstream sales.\r\nEOL? - Need a more liquid market - more demand\r\nRenewable Portfolio Standard -- The proposed CA RPS has major implications =\r\nfor our business, from both a risk management and commercial opportunity pe=\r\nrspective. We need to really drill down on this today and get as much insig=\r\nht as to the political climate as possible. Having witnessed the first meet=\r\ning of the California Power Authority last Friday in Sacramento, I am perso=\r\nnally convinced that the RPS will definitely be passed in some shape or for=\r\nm. If they pass a 1% requirement for new renewables next year, this transla=\r\ntes into 430MWm off a 43,000MW peak load in CA. We have very good working r=\r\nelationships with several of the biomass generators in California, includin=\r\ng generators with new resources, and we are actively negotiating a marketin=\r\ng agreement with one of them and considering taking a long position for the=\r\n next couple of years. The critical question, of course, is who will actual=\r\nly have the short position in California? If it is just the DWR, then they =\r\nwill probably satisfy their requirement with their new renewables purchases=\r\n. If the utilities end up serving load, they will be in the market looking =\r\nfor the least-cost resources, and new biomass will clearly be a part of the=\r\n mix.\r\nnational RPS - follow up with John Shelk\r\nStir up demand\r\nPac Northwest RFPs -- Both PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric have RF=\r\nPs out right now for green tags and retail marketing services. I am staying=\r\n in touch with Bonneville Environmental Foundation, Green Mountain Energy a=\r\nnd Community Energy to act as a wholesaler for their tag submissions. I wan=\r\nt to get master services contracts in place with each of these entities to =\r\nmake it really easy for them to transact with us. We can use our market leg=\r\ns to get well-priced tags and then sell to them as they shoot for RFP succe=\r\nsses. Bonneville Environmental, at a minimum, will need new biomass to blen=\r\nd in with their expensive wind energy tags.\r\n\r\nChicago -- Most of you probably met Mike Lindert at our Houston Renewables =\r\nmeeting earlier this month.

It will be beneficial in moving our decision process forward.\n\nI have attached Kinko's comments to the Enron Sales Agreeement for power in TX. I have divided the comments into three separate sections: Administrative, Contractual and Clarification Questions/Comments. At first glance it might seem like a lot, but once you get a chance to review it, you will see there are really only a handful of issues we need to iron out.

Since we are now\ntalking an October\nclose date, we cannot start services until Dec. which will only give you a one\nmonth discount.\nI would recommend we just price the deal assuming no discount (might be lower\nfixed gen rate)\nand just start services 1/1/02.\nI would rather not refresh the 3 year pricing unless you really need it because\nit makes more\nsense for us to do it when we are ready to execute. You can just assume the\npricing I sent to\nyou 8/20 is about a $1.00 Mwh lower than what is shown for fixed gen.\nThanks\nKay\n(See attached file: kinko's proposal-revised 1 year term.xls)\n\n - Kinko's Comments to Docs of 8-23.doc \n","content":"\nRichard- I am talking with Larry at Kinko's today at 4 pm to address the comments he has outlined in the file below\nI need your help in addressing his change of language request (see 2.8 Last few sentences under Contractual comments)\nHe does not want us to keep the potential credits from green power-see his comment on page 2 of document below\nCan you help me address this with him? \nPlease give me a call - I don't think it is necessary for you to have to sit thru the call with us this afternoon on all other comments\nthanks\nKay\n","messageId":"<20607038.1075858656442.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-09-17T21:42:56+05:30","from":"kay.quigley@enron.com","subject":"Kinko's comments","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Quigley, Kay </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=AD340814-B3C280AB-862564FE-52D820>","xTo":"Ring, Richard </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=RRING>","xFolder":"\\RRING (Non-Privileged)\\EESIRenewableEnergy","xOrigin":"Ring-R","xFileName":"RRING (Non-Privileged)1.pst","to":"richard.ring@enron.com"}

After you've had a chance to digest the below, I'm glad t=\r\no help out in our response.\r\n1. RPS and disclosure requirements need to be developed together.  Further,=\r\n since environmental disclosure is a requirement in 14 states and RPS in 7 =\r\nstates, it's important that we don't have overlapping, redundant requiremen=\r\nts on a national level.

For disclosure, the label calculation (how you derive the fuel mix) is =\r\nthe most crucial. Suppliers need the following:=20\r\n=09a. the ability to project what they will deliver to customers over a spe=\r\ncified \"settlement period\" (we greatly prefer annually) if they are differe=\r\nntiating their products (either with bilateral contracts or claims about th=\r\ne environmental benefits of the product). Otherwise, suppliers would submit=\r\n a label with the default mix for spot market purchases.

For RPS and disclosure:  It is extremely important that any national RPS=\r\n/disclosure requirement be developed with a certificate trading program.

This should be a tradable =\r\ninstrument separate from the power.  Renewable energy certificates \"RECs\" c=\r\nan be bought sold, traded separately from power, and allows vital flexibili=\r\nty to get renewables to regions of the country where the supply might be co=\r\nnstrained or where renewables such as wind and solar are not conducive to b=\r\neing sited.  RECs also provide verification for the purchase of power attri=\r\nbutes for RPS and disclosure. As Christi was stating below, it is impossibl=\r\ne with our sophisticated wholesale markets to track all electrons from gene=\r\nration to end use consumption.  The beauty of certificate trading programs =\r\nis that they create a secondary market by which the attributes of power can=\r\n be tracked through various trades.

It encourages the Member States to take the measures\nneeded to guarantee the development of renewable energies in line with the\nnational and Community objectives. It responses to the challenges\nconcerning the reduction of the EU 's energetic dependence, the\npreservation of its capacity to choose its energy in the future while\nlimiting the greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric pollutants dangerous\nfor the health.\n\n\"In Bonn, Europe has saved the Kyoto Protocol.

In Belgium, for example, the share of electricity produced\nwith those energy sources will have to reach 6% in 2010. The European\nCommission will have to monitor the conformity of the actions taken at\nnational level. Four years after the implementation the directive, the\nCommission will have the opportunity to propose a more harmonised system\nof aid, on the basis of the experience of the Member States.\n\nOther measures introduced by the directive are : the introduction of a\nsystem of certification of green electricity, the creation of accompanying\nmeasures designed to create suitable conditions for the introduction of\nRSE on the domestic market while respecting rules of competition, to\nensure a certification within two years of entry into force of the\ndirective, to accelerate the authorisation procedure applicable to the\nestablishment of production centres for green electricity, to guarantee\nthat the calculation of connection costs for new producers are\nnon-discriminatory.\n\nThe main sources of renewable energy are : water power, solar energy, wind\npower, biomass, biogas (for example from mud coming from waste treatment,\nbiological fuel).\n\nVincent Georis (0474/98 48 69)\n\n\n\nDate: 07/09/2001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>","content":"\n\n\nStacey Bolton\nEnvironmental Strategies\nEnron Corp\n713-853-9916 direct \n713-303-2632 cell \nsbolton@enron.com <mailto:sbolton@enron.com>\n \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tJacobson, Lisa  \nSent:\tFriday, September 07, 2001 10:14 AM\nTo:\tKeeler, Jeff; Bolton, Stacey; Mainzer, Elliot; Schoen, Mary; McKalip-Thompson, Catherine\nSubject:\tFW: Renewables directive finally adopted\n\n\nFYI and please pass on to others...\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDindarova, Nailia  \nSent:\tFriday, September 07, 2001 11:05 AM\nTo:\tDan Badger/LON/ECT@ENRON; Diana Profir/LON/ECT@ENRON; Jacobson, Lisa\nCc:\tHussain, Mustafa; Duvauchelle, Antoine; Orsenigo, Enrico; Mark Konijnenberg/EU/Enron@ENRON; Styles, Peter\nSubject:\tRenewables directive finally adopted\n\nPlease see below the press release regarding the adoption by the European Council of the renewables directive.

{"rawContent":"\nGreetings all --\r\nGiven my rather other-world state on yesterday's conference call, I wanted =\r\nto fire off an e-mail to you to summarize current commercial activities on =\r\nthe Renewable Power Desk. I appreciate all the work you guys are doing and =\r\nfeel as though we're really gaining some traction.\r\n\r\nGreen Power Market Development Group -- We will be submitting a proposal to=\r\n the Wind Energy Working Group of the Green Power Market Development Group =\r\n(headed by Mark Crowdis of Think Energy) on Tuesday with a variety of prici=\r\nng proposals for products ranging from physical commodity with green tags t=\r\no green tags with embedded call options. Richard and I are working together=\r\n to develop pricing for tags in the Pac Northwest, California, Texas and th=\r\ne East. I feel good about our chances of getting something done with these =\r\nguys as they are feeling the heat to do something concrete after making so =\r\nmany public declarations of intent. As we move forward, I think we should a=\r\nll do a lot of thinking about other companies we should approach for this t=\r\nype of product. Once the Enron Building is juiced with wind power, we will =\r\nbe able to approach other fortune 500 companies with a straight face and en=\r\ncourage them to become Green Power Alliance Customers. During the week of S=\r\neptember 11, I plan to be in Houston to work extensively on drawing up the =\r\nguidelines for the Alliance Program and working more closely with Richard a=\r\nnd Stacey and their EES contacts to develop green power products for up-str=\r\neam marketing and new origination efforts.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles Department of Water and Power -- LADWP is the largest green pow=\r\ner buyer among public power agencies in California. Their green power buyer=\r\n is heavily understaffed (and somewhat outgunned in terms of industry knowl=\r\nedge). He has hired us to help him bring his contract negotiations to fruit=\r\nion, manage logistics for new projects and essentially sleeve new renewable=\r\n power products through Enron's existing Master Services Agreement with LAD=\r\nWP. This is an exciting (although not very profitable at this point) opport=\r\nunity to establish the nodes of the California Renewable Power Pool and we =\r\nsee this as a way to bring our Services Desk functions to bear on the renew=\r\nable sector in California. I am meeting with FPL Energy next week to discus=\r\ns becoming the logistics coordinator for their new wind projects in Califor=\r\nnia.\r\n\r\nWind Development -- As you may know, I purchased an option on a large parce=\r\nl of windy land in Central Washington with enXco, a wind development concer=\r\nn. We are marketing the project to two of the munis in the Pacific Northwes=\r\nt (Seattle City Light and Eugene Water and Electric Board). Both have expre=\r\nssed interest. This morning I am meeting with the City of Portland to try t=\r\no convince Portland to follow Seattle's lead as a zero-carbon growth city a=\r\nnd signatory to the type of Kyotoesque committments recently announced by N=\r\new England legislators.\r\n\r\nRenewable Portfolio Standard -- The proposed CA RPS has major implications =\r\nfor our business, from both a risk management and commercial opportunity pe=\r\nrspective. We need to really drill down on this today and get as much insig=\r\nht as to the political climate as possible. Having witnessed the first meet=\r\ning of the California Power Authority last Friday in Sacramento, I am perso=\r\nnally convinced that the RPS will definitely be passed in some shape or for=\r\nm. If they pass a 1% requirement for new renewables next year, this transla=\r\ntes into 430MWm off a 43,000MW peak load in CA. We have very good working r=\r\nelationships with several of the biomass generators in California, includin=\r\ng generators with new resources, and we are actively negotiating a marketin=\r\ng agreement with one of them and considering taking a long position for the=\r\n next couple of years. The critical question, of course, is who will actual=\r\nly have the short position in California? If it is just the DWR, then they =\r\nwill probably satisfy their requirement with their new renewables purchases=\r\n. If the utilities end up serving load, they will be in the market looking =\r\nfor the least-cost resources, and new biomass will clearly be a part of the=\r\n mix.\r\n\r\nPac Northwest RFPs -- Both PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric have RF=\r\nPs out right now for green tags and retail marketing services. I am staying=\r\n in touch with Bonneville Environmental Foundation, Green Mountain Energy a=\r\nnd Community Energy to act as a wholesaler for their tag submissions. I wan=\r\nt to get master services contracts in place with each of these entities to =\r\nmake it really easy for them to transact with us. We can use our market leg=\r\ns to get well-priced tags and then sell to them as they shoot for RFP succe=\r\nsses. Bonneville Environmental, at a minimum, will need new biomass to blen=\r\nd in with their expensive wind energy tags.\r\n\r\nChicago -- Most of you probably met Mike Lindert at our Houston Renewables =\r\nmeeting earlier this month. He was the EES originator for the ComEd deal, a=\r\nnd as you know, there is a significant renewable committment in Chicago. We=\r\n need to get in front of the City of Chicago as soon as possible to talk ab=\r\nout their next generation of renewable purchases. Stacey, I belive you have=\r\n info on this.\r\n\r\nSustainable Products Training -- The Renewable Power Desk has donated RECs =\r\nand CO2 offsets for the Sustainable Products Training in Austin, September =\r\n10 - 11. They are giving us lots of press and would like one or two of us t=\r\no attend. If you are interested in heading up there for a day with me, plea=\r\nse let me know. There should be a pretty good turnout among potential comme=\r\nrcial and industrial customers.\r\n\r\nKinkos -- All indications are that our negotiations with Kinko's are going =\r\nvery well. The hope is to sell them a three-year fixed-price retail product=\r\n and 100% wind tags. Richard and I are woking to source the tags. Success w=\r\nill be huge, as Kinkos is part of the Green Power Market Development Group.\r\n\r\nI know that Richard and Stacey have other deals on the table, and Jesse has=\r\n been busy working on finalizing our services deal with Edwards Air Force B=\r\nase. I look forward to seeing you guys in Houston the week of September 11 =\r\nand taking the next steps in formalizing our green product offerings.\r\n\r\nTalk to you soon,\r\n\r\nEM\r\n\r\nElliot Mainzer\r\nRenewable Power Desk\r\nEnron North America\r\n121 SW Salmon St.\r\n3WTC-0306\r\nPortland, OR  97201\r\n(503) 464-3706\r\n(503) 464-3740 (FX)\r\n(503) 709-6959 (CL)","content":"\nGreetings all --\r\nGiven my rather other-world state on yesterday's conference call, I wanted =\r\nto fire off an e-mail to you to summarize current commercial activities on =\r\nthe Renewable Power Desk. I appreciate all the work you guys are doing and =\r\nfeel as though we're really gaining some traction.\r\n\r\nGreen Power Market Development Group -- We will be submitting a proposal to=\r\n the Wind Energy Working Group of the Green Power Market Development Group =\r\n(headed by Mark Crowdis of Think Energy) on Tuesday with a variety of prici=\r\nng proposals for products ranging from physical commodity with green tags t=\r\no green tags with embedded call options. Richard and I are working together=\r\n to develop pricing for tags in the Pac Northwest, California, Texas and th=\r\ne East. I feel good about our chances of getting something done with these =\r\nguys as they are feeling the heat to do something concrete after making so =\r\nmany public declarations of intent. As we move forward, I think we should a=\r\nll do a lot of thinking about other companies we should approach for this t=\r\nype of product.

Unfortunately it wasn't what =\r\nwe wanted to hear.\r\n\r\nOn the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=\r\ne turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =\r\nthey are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =\r\ncustomers received a letter letting them know about it.\r\n\r\nOn the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=\r\nommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =\r\nbeen ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=\r\n IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=\r\nously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =\r\nsubmitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=\r\nides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=\r\ntch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=\r\nhen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =\r\nde-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=\r\nann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=\r\nw contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=\r\nRed to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=\r\nrs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =\r\nour larger customers through the reps.\r\n\r\nSo - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=\r\nn annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =\r\nthey're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=\r\n .......\r\n\r\n1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=\r\non, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =\r\nPeggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.\r\n2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=\r\n as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=\r\nived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=\r\ne should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=\r\ne will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=\r\n  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =\r\ndon't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=\r\nta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=\r\nhird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20\r\n3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =\r\nas of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=\r\nIX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=\r\non.  Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know.=20\r\n4.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =\r\nthose given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =\r\nis impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolto=\r\nn, Stacey]   We should discuss this a bit.  I'm not sure that this will rea=\r\nlly matter at the end of the day.  The CEC has instructed us all along to s=\r\nend labels to the customers, which we have.  We'll report the purchases (br=\r\nown and green) as normal at the end of the year.=20\r\n\r\nLet me know your input.\r\n\r\nHeather\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","content":"\nPeggy:\r\n\r\nLet me know if you did not receive the copies of the bizmix letters I sent =\r\ndown to you?\r\n\r\nStacey Bolton\r\nEnvironmental Strategies\r\nEnron Corp\r\n713-853-9916 direct=20\r\n713-303-2632 cell=20\r\nsbolton@enron.com <mailto:sbolton@enron.com>\r\n=20\r\n\r\n -----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: =09Mathis, Heather =20\r\nSent:=09Wednesday, August 29, 2001 7:56 AM\r\nTo:=09Mahoney, Peggy; Bolton, Stacey\r\nCc:=09Castano, Marianne; Ring, Richard\r\nSubject:=09RE: CA BIZMIX Issues/Confidential\r\n\r\nPeggy/Stacey:\r\n\r\nWhat is the status of this letter?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nHeather\r\n---------------------- Forwarded by Heather Mathis/HOU/EES on 08/29/2001 07=\r\n:54 AM ---------------------------\r\nFrom:=09Stacey Bolton/ENRON@enronXgate on 08/06/2001 03:00 PM\r\nTo:=09Marianne Castano/HOU/EES@EES, Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES\r\ncc:=09Richard Ring/HOU/EES@EES, Heather Mathis/HOU/EES@EES=20\r\nSubject:=09RE: CA BIZMIX Issues/Confidential\r\n\r\nI'm sending down a copy of the letters.\r\n\r\nStacey Bolton\r\nEnvironmental Strategies\r\nEnron Corp\r\n713-853-9916 direct=20\r\n713-303-2632 cell=20\r\nsbolton@enron.com <mailto:sbolton@enron.com>\r\n=20\r\n\r\n -----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: =09Castano, Marianne =20\r\nSent:=09Monday, August 06, 2001 2:59 PM\r\nTo:=09Mahoney, Peggy\r\nCc:=09Ring, Richard; Bolton, Stacey; Mathis, Heather\r\nSubject:=09RE: CA BIZMIX Issues/Confidential\r\n\r\nThanks, Peggy...MLC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >>=20\r\nPeggy Mahoney\r\n08/06/2001 01:16 PM\r\nTo:=09Marianne Castano/HOU/EES@EES\r\ncc:=09=20\r\nSubject:=09RE: CA BIZMIX Issues/Confidential   << OLE Object: StdOleLink >>=\r\n=20\r\n\r\nI just talked to Stacey and I think we'll send a letter discussing the fact=\r\n that the funds have\r\nrun out, etc.  I'll be back to you with a draft.\r\nThanks\r\nPeggy   =20\r\n\r\n\r\n << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >>=20\r\nMarianne Castano\r\n08/02/2001 12:05 PM\r\nTo:=09Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES\r\ncc:=09=20\r\nSubject:=09RE: CA BIZMIX Issues/Confidential\r\n\r\n << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >>  =09 << OLE Object: =\r\nPicture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> =09\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is in regard to discontinuation of the Biz Mix product -- as you can s=\r\nee from the messages from Stacey below, we have stopped offering the produc=\r\nt because the energy credit funds have been depleted.

My understanding is that surpri=\r\nsingly some of the money that we've already submitted has been paid due (de=\r\nspite the fund being depleted) to overpayment/accounting issues with other =\r\nentities.  This also has to do w/ the time lapse between filing for reimbur=\r\nsement for 3 months prior (i.e. I don't think Richard anticipated getting p=\r\naid for some of January's purchases because technically the fund ran out in=\r\n December).

Thanks Heather for the helpful update.\r\n -----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: =09Mathis, Heather =20\r\nSent:=09Tuesday, July 31, 2001 1:30 PM\r\nTo:=09Bolton, Stacey; Ring, Richard; Castano, Marianne\r\nSubject:=09CA BIZMIX Issues\r\n\r\nHello all!\r\n\r\nI met with Diann Huddleson today and she clarified some issues for me regar=\r\nding the DASRing of customers in California.  Unfortunately it wasn't what =\r\nwe wanted to hear.\r\n\r\nOn the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=\r\ne turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =\r\nthey are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =\r\ncustomers received a letter letting them know about it.\r\n\r\nOn the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=\r\nommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =\r\nbeen ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=\r\n IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=\r\nously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =\r\nsubmitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=\r\nides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=\r\ntch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=\r\nhen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =\r\nde-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=\r\nann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=\r\nw contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=\r\nRed to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=\r\nrs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =\r\nour larger customers through the reps.\r\n\r\nSo - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=\r\nn annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =\r\nthey're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=\r\n .......\r\n\r\n1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=\r\non, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =\r\nPeggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.\r\n2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=\r\n as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=\r\nived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=\r\ne should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=\r\ne will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=\r\n  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =\r\ndon't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=\r\nta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=\r\nhird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20\r\n3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =\r\nas of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=\r\nIX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=\r\non.  Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know.=20\r\n4.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =\r\nthose given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =\r\nis impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolto=\r\nn, Stacey]   We should discuss this a bit.  I'm not sure that this will rea=\r\nlly matter at the end of the day.  The CEC has instructed us all along to s=\r\nend labels to the customers, which we have.  We'll report the purchases (br=\r\nown and green) as normal at the end of the year.=20\r\n\r\nLet me know your input.\r\n\r\nHeather\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>\r\n<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>\r\n<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>\r\n<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>","content":"\nPeggy/Stacey:\r\n\r\nWhat is the status of this letter?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nHeather\r\n","messageId":"<1038234.1075858657474.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-08-29T18:26:00+05:30","from":"heather.mathis@enron.com","subject":"RE: CA BIZMIX Issues/Confidential","cc":"marianne.castano@enron.com, richard.ring@enron.com","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"quoted-printable","bcc":"marianne.castano@enron.com, richard.ring@enron.com","xFrom":"Mathis, Heather </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=76738371-1EF543B2-8625693C-73C643>","xTo":"Mahoney, Peggy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=6BFC28E1-9B297B26-862566B4-5E89BF>, Bolton, Stacey </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SBOLTON>","xCc":"Castano, Marianne </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=E1A26E0C-DEFE690-862564C6-6A59F0>, Ring, Richard </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=RRING>","xFolder":"\\RRING (Non-Privileged)\\EESIRenewableEnergy","xOrigin":"Ring-R","xFileName":"RRING (Non-Privileged)1.pst","to":"peggy.mahoney@enron.com,stacey.bolton@enron.com"}

{"rawContent":"\nIt's that time of year again - sending out 3rd quarter labels to California.  Richard & I were talking this morning and had several questions.\n\nFirst - how do we reflect to our customers that used to receive BIZMIX (large commercials) in their projected labels that for the first month of the year (according to Diann Hudleston they were initially de-DASRed on Jan 31) they received the BIZMIX fuel mix and for the rest of the year the system mix?  Do we need to do a label showing a column for the Jan mix and a column for the rest of year mix with a footnote?  Additionally, has Peggy Mahoney's letter gone out yet?  I'd hate for a notation on a label to be the first thing a customer sees about this.  There is a bit of time, however, as these will go out in the October billing cycle (CSC has to have them 9/10).\n\nSecond - We returned our residential customers to the utilities the end of June.  Do we still need to send them a projected 2001 label in 3rd & 4th quarters since we did not provide their electricity during those periods?  I presume we will, however, have to send them a historical 2001 label next spring, since we did provide their electricity for at least first half of the year.\n\nThanks.\n\nHeather","content":"\nIt's that time of year again - sending out 3rd quarter labels to California.

See 220 CMR 11.06(2)(1)(a)(c)  Although the price looks back to the last month of the prior quarter, the \"would have been charged\" language suggests that an estimate can be used.\n\nIn ME, \"service based on spot or other variable prices shall be shown based on the average prices that would have been charged in the prior month\"  also reported on an average unit price in cents per kWh. See MPUC 65-407-306(2)(a)(iii).  Note that ME uses the same \"would have been charged\" language.\n\nHope that helps.

The EPA has committed to buy\nmore than 5 million kilowatt-hours per year of so-called\ngreen power for the three facilities over the next three years.\nCommunity Energy, Inc. will provide nearly 800,000 kilowatt-\nhours of electricity each year from the Mill Run wind facility\nnow being built in Pennsylvania, and Commonwealth Edison\nof Illinois will provide the remainder from its landfill gas\nfacilities. When the power purchase is underway in early\n2002, EPA will be buying nine percent of its total electricity\nuse from renewable energy sources. See the press release\non the EPA home page at: <http://www.epa.gov/>.\n\nThe customers of Minnesota Power in northeastern\nMinnesota and northwestern Wisconsin can now follow the\nEPA's lead. Minnesota Power, a subsidiary of Allete, is now\noffering wind power to its residential and small commercial\ncustomers through a program called WindSense. The\ncompany is selling the wind power at a premium cost of\n$2.50 per 100 kilowatt-hours. See the Allete press release\nat: <http://www.allete.com/placed/08-21-2001wind.html>.\n\nEleven leaders in the development of the U.S. green\npower market received the first annual Green Power\nLeadership Awards in late July. The awards were presented\nto companies, universities, organizations and individuals\nduring the Sixth National Green Power Marketing Conference\nin Portland, Oregon. See the list of awards on the conference\nWeb site on EREN at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/greenpower/conference/gpawards01.html>.\n\n\nNREL Awards $40 Million for Thin-Film Solar Cells\n\nDOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) announced last\nweek its award of $40 million to 19 universities and 14 companies\nfor the development of thin-film photovoltaic solar cells. Compared\nto conventional crystalline-silicon solar cells, thin-film cells use\nrelatively little of the expensive semiconductor materials, so\nthey hold the potential to be produced at a low cost. See the\nNREL press release at:\n<http://www.nrel.gov/hot-stuff/press/3201_cheaper.html>.\n\n\nSolar Carport Under Construction in Riverside, California\n\nA new 113-kilowatt photovoltaic system is now under\nconstruction in Riverside, California. Schott Applied Power\nCorporation is building a solar carport for the city that will\ngenerate power while providing shade for cars. See the\nSchott Applied Power press release at:\n<http://www.us.schott.com/apc/english/news/press.html?NID=23>.\n\nA much larger solar power system may eventually be built in\nMassachusetts. Spire Corporation is helping the City of\nBrockton to assess the feasibility of building a solar power\nfacility on an abandoned industrial site. The proposed site\nwill cover 27 acres and generate 5 to 10 megawatts of power\n-- enough to power 3,000 homes. See the Spire press\nrelease at: <http://www.spirecorp.com/Spire/news/PV367.html>.\n\nOld industrial sites, usually contaminated with hazardous\nchemicals, are often referred to as brownfields. The\nBrockton project is one example of the concept of using\nsolar energy to convert brownfields into what are being\ncalled \"brightfields.\" See the Brightfields Web site on EREN\nat: <http://www.eren.doe.gov/brightfields/>.\n\n\nBiodiesel Fuels Backup Power System at UC Riverside\n\nRiverside, California, is also the location of a unique backup\npower system using three 2-megawatt generators that are\npowered entirely by biodiesel fuel. Southern States Power\nCompany, Inc. installed the system at the University of\nCalifornia, Riverside and is supplying the biodiesel fuel. The\ncompany also announced last month that the City of\nClaremont, California, is using a 20 percent blend of its\nbiodiesel to fuel the city's sanitation vehicles. See the press\nreleases on the Southern States Power Web site at:\n<http://www.sspowerco.com/press.html>.\n\n\nFuelCell Energy Starts Up Fuel Cell/Microturbine System\n\nFuelCell Energy, Inc. announced last week that it has started\noperating one of its 250-kilowatt fuel cells in tandem with a\n30-kilowatt microturbine from Capstone Turbine Corporation.\nThe microturbine is driven by hot exhaust gas from the fuel\ncell -- usually the microturbines are driven by combustion of\nnatural gas. DOE is funding the test of the combined system.\n\nFuelCell Energy also announced last week that it has\nreceived a $1.25 million contract to install a 250-kilowatt fuel\ncell power plant at the University of Connecticut. The\nConnecticut Clean Energy Fund is funding the installation,\nwhich will be completed in 2002.\n\nSee the August 14th and 16th press releases on the\nFuelCell Energy Web site at:\n<http://www.fuelcellenergy.com/site/investor/press/releases.html>.\n\n\nLandfill Gas Powers 50 Microturbines in Los Angeles\n\nThe Los Angeles Department of Power and Water (LADWP)\nannounced last week the startup of a new facility that\nproduces 1.5 megawatts of electricity from landfill gas. The\nfacility uses methane emissions from the Lopez Canyon\nLandfill to power 50 Capstone microturbines, generating\nenough power for 1,500 homes. It adds to a six-megawatt\nlandfill gas power plant that was already operating at the\nsite. See the LADWP press release at:\n<http://www.ladwp.com/whatnew/dwpnews/081601.htm>.\n\n\nDOE Passes Energy-Efficient Light Project to Private Sector\n\nA DOE program to encourage the encourage the production\nand use of shorter, brighter, and more affordable compact\nfluorescent lamps (CFLs) is now being turned over to the\nprivate sector. DOE announced on Monday that the so-called\n\"sub-CFL\" program, established by DOE's Pacific Northwest\nNational Laboratory, will now be handed off to the Northwest\nEnergy Efficiency Alliance, a nonprofit organization. CFLs\nuse about a quarter of the energy used by standard\nincandescent bulbs, last up to 10 times longer, and\ngenerate much less heat.\n\nThe program encouraged the development of 17 new CFLs\nand is currently saving U.S. consumers more than $22 million\nin electricity costs each year. See the DOE press release at:\n<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases01/augpr/pr01147.htm>.\n\nThe new Web site for the program, called BetterBulbsDirect.com,\nfeatures CFLs from two manufacturers. Online ordering is available\nat discount prices, but the minimum order is 10 bulbs. See\nthe Web site at: <http://www.betterbulbsdirect.com/>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSITE NEWS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRoadmaps to Energy Efficiency\n<http://energyroadmaps.org/>\n\nThis site, sponsored by Global Green USA and Environment\nNow, provides a step-by-step guide to retrofitting commercial\nproperties to improve energy efficiency and reduce operating\ncosts. The site features three approaches, called RoadMaps:\ndo it yourself, hire an energy consultant firm, or work with an\nenergy service company. Each RoadMap is presented as a\nflowchart that outlines the specific steps of the process and\nprovides direct links to useful information and resources. The\nsite also includes case studies that demonstrate the benefits\nthat have been achieved in buildings throughout the country.\n\nFor this and other recent additions to the EREN Web site,\nsee <http://www.eren.doe.gov/new/whats-new.html>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nENERGY FACTS AND TIPS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncome Up For Major Energy Companies in Second Quarter\n\nThe second quarter of 2001 yielded a surge in net income\nfor 26 major energy companies, according to a new report by\nDOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA). Net income\nfor these companies increased by 10 percent compared to\nthe same time period in 2000. The largest increases occurred\nin the petroleum industry, at 35 percent, and the natural gas\nand power industries, at 30 percent. Domestic petroleum\ncompanies saw a 38 percent increase in income. Domestic\npetroleum refining and marketing experienced a 78 percent\nincrease in income. See the EIA report, \"Financial News for\nMajor Energy Companies,\" at:\n<http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/perfpro/news_m/index.html>.\n\nIf you're interested in petroleum company incomes, you may\nalso be interested in the EIA's list of world energy \"areas to\nwatch,\" which includes oil-producing countries that are\nexperiencing political or economic troubles. The countries\nencircle the globe, from Angola to the Caspian Sea, from\nIndonesia to Venezuela.

Compared\nto conventional crystalline-silicon solar cells, thin-film cells use\nrelatively little of the expensive semiconductor materials, so\nthey hold the potential to be produced at a low cost. See the\nNREL press release at:\n<http://www.nrel.gov/hot-stuff/press/3201_cheaper.html>.\n\n\nSolar Carport Under Construction in Riverside, California\n\nA new 113-kilowatt photovoltaic system is now under\nconstruction in Riverside, California. Schott Applied Power\nCorporation is building a solar carport for the city that will\ngenerate power while providing shade for cars. See the\nSchott Applied Power press release at:\n<http://www.us.schott.com/apc/english/news/press.html?NID=23>.\n\nA much larger solar power system may eventually be built in\nMassachusetts. Spire Corporation is helping the City of\nBrockton to assess the feasibility of building a solar power\nfacility on an abandoned industrial site. The proposed site\nwill cover 27 acres and generate 5 to 10 megawatts of power\n-- enough to power 3,000 homes. See the Spire press\nrelease at: <http://www.spirecorp.com/Spire/news/PV367.html>.\n\nOld industrial sites, usually contaminated with hazardous\nchemicals, are often referred to as brownfields. The\nBrockton project is one example of the concept of using\nsolar energy to convert brownfields into what are being\ncalled \"brightfields.\" See the Brightfields Web site on EREN\nat: <http://www.eren.doe.gov/brightfields/>.\n\n\nBiodiesel Fuels Backup Power System at UC Riverside\n\nRiverside, California, is also the location of a unique backup\npower system using three 2-megawatt generators that are\npowered entirely by biodiesel fuel. Southern States Power\nCompany, Inc. installed the system at the University of\nCalifornia, Riverside and is supplying the biodiesel fuel. The\ncompany also announced last month that the City of\nClaremont, California, is using a 20 percent blend of its\nbiodiesel to fuel the city's sanitation vehicles. See the press\nreleases on the Southern States Power Web site at:\n<http://www.sspowerco.com/press.html>.\n\n\nFuelCell Energy Starts Up Fuel Cell/Microturbine System\n\nFuelCell Energy, Inc. announced last week that it has started\noperating one of its 250-kilowatt fuel cells in tandem with a\n30-kilowatt microturbine from Capstone Turbine Corporation.\nThe microturbine is driven by hot exhaust gas from the fuel\ncell -- usually the microturbines are driven by combustion of\nnatural gas. DOE is funding the test of the combined system.\n\nFuelCell Energy also announced last week that it has\nreceived a $1.25 million contract to install a 250-kilowatt fuel\ncell power plant at the University of Connecticut. The\nConnecticut Clean Energy Fund is funding the installation,\nwhich will be completed in 2002.\n\nSee the August 14th and 16th press releases on the\nFuelCell Energy Web site at:\n<http://www.fuelcellenergy.com/site/investor/press/releases.html>.\n\n\nLandfill Gas Powers 50 Microturbines in Los Angeles\n\nThe Los Angeles Department of Power and Water (LADWP)\nannounced last week the startup of a new facility that\nproduces 1.5 megawatts of electricity from landfill gas. The\nfacility uses methane emissions from the Lopez Canyon\nLandfill to power 50 Capstone microturbines, generating\nenough power for 1,500 homes. It adds to a six-megawatt\nlandfill gas power plant that was already operating at the\nsite. See the LADWP press release at:\n<http://www.ladwp.com/whatnew/dwpnews/081601.htm>.\n\n\nDOE Passes Energy-Efficient Light Project to Private Sector\n\nA DOE program to encourage the encourage the production\nand use of shorter, brighter, and more affordable compact\nfluorescent lamps (CFLs) is now being turned over to the\nprivate sector. DOE announced on Monday that the so-called\n\"sub-CFL\" program, established by DOE's Pacific Northwest\nNational Laboratory, will now be handed off to the Northwest\nEnergy Efficiency Alliance, a nonprofit organization. CFLs\nuse about a quarter of the energy used by standard\nincandescent bulbs, last up to 10 times longer, and\ngenerate much less heat.\n\nThe program encouraged the development of 17 new CFLs\nand is currently saving U.S. consumers more than $22 million\nin electricity costs each year. See the DOE press release at:\n<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases01/augpr/pr01147.htm>.\n\nThe new Web site for the program, called BetterBulbsDirect.com,\nfeatures CFLs from two manufacturers. Online ordering is available\nat discount prices, but the minimum order is 10 bulbs. See\nthe Web site at: <http://www.betterbulbsdirect.com/>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSITE NEWS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRoadmaps to Energy Efficiency\n<http://energyroadmaps.org/>\n\nThis site, sponsored by Global Green USA and Environment\nNow, provides a step-by-step guide to retrofitting commercial\nproperties to improve energy efficiency and reduce operating\ncosts. The site features three approaches, called RoadMaps:\ndo it yourself, hire an energy consultant firm, or work with an\nenergy service company. Each RoadMap is presented as a\nflowchart that outlines the specific steps of the process and\nprovides direct links to useful information and resources. The\nsite also includes case studies that demonstrate the benefits\nthat have been achieved in buildings throughout the country.\n\nFor this and other recent additions to the EREN Web site,\nsee <http://www.eren.doe.gov/new/whats-new.html>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nENERGY FACTS AND TIPS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncome Up For Major Energy Companies in Second Quarter\n\nThe second quarter of 2001 yielded a surge in net income\nfor 26 major energy companies, according to a new report by\nDOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA). Net income\nfor these companies increased by 10 percent compared to\nthe same time period in 2000. The largest increases occurred\nin the petroleum industry, at 35 percent, and the natural gas\nand power industries, at 30 percent. Domestic petroleum\ncompanies saw a 38 percent increase in income. Domestic\npetroleum refining and marketing experienced a 78 percent\nincrease in income. See the EIA report, \"Financial News for\nMajor Energy Companies,\" at:\n<http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/perfpro/news_m/index.html>.\n\nIf you're interested in petroleum company incomes, you may\nalso be interested in the EIA's list of world energy \"areas to\nwatch,\" which includes oil-producing countries that are\nexperiencing political or economic troubles. The countries\nencircle the globe, from Angola to the Caspian Sea, from\nIndonesia to Venezuela. See the EIA's list at:\n<http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/hot.html>.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nABOUT THIS NEWSLETTER\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can subscribe to this newsletter using the online form at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/subscribe/>.\nThis Web page also allows you to update your email address\nor unsubscribe to this newsletter.\n\nThe Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Network (EREN)\nhome page is located at <http://www.eren.doe.gov/>.\n\nIf you have questions or comments about this\nnewsletter, please contact the editor, Kevin Eber, at\nkevin_eber@nrel.gov.\n","messageId":"<26551304.1075858658153.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-08-22T11:30:00+05:30","from":"keber@mail.nrel.gov","subject":"EREN Network News -- 08/22/01","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Kevin Eber  <keber@mail.nrel.gov>","xTo":"eren <eren@mail.nrel.gov>","xFolder":"\\RRING (Non-Privileged)\\EESIRenewableEnergy","xOrigin":"Ring-R","xFileName":"RRING (Non-Privileged)1.pst","to":"eren@mail.nrel.gov"}

Skilling abruptly resigned. Chairman Kenneth L.

I do not want to be obligated to provide \"all the environmental att=\r\nributes\" to Customer if either (i) Enron does not acquire all of the enviro=\r\nnmental attributes it its transaction to acquire the \"renewable energy and/=\r\nor renewable credits/attributes\" or (ii) as normal course of business regar=\r\nding transaction of \"renewable energy and/or renewable credits/attributes\" =\r\nall of the environmental attributes do not transfer with title to the \"rene=\r\nwable energy and/or renewable credits/attributes\".\r\n\r\nI would propose to replace the above referenced contract language with the =\r\nfollowing:  \"EESI will ensure that the Energy delivered to Customer will be=\r\n associated with generation of an equivalent amount of renewable energy and=\r\n that all of the environmental attributes, as a normal course of business, =\r\nassociated with the purchase and sale of renewable energy and/or renewable =\r\ncredits shall pass from EESI to Customer.\"  =20\r\n\r\nUnder Section 7, DEFINITIONS, the current definition for \"Renewable Energy\"=\r\n states \"means electric energy generated by facilities utilizing renewable =\r\nenergy sources.  This would include facilities like windmill farms, photovo=\r\nltaic cells, geothermal heat recovery plants, landfill gas recover plants, =\r\nand small, selective hydroelectric projects no greater than 20 MW.  These f=\r\nacilities use existing natural systems (wind, sun, thermal heat from the ea=\r\nrth, biological decomposition and flowing water) to generate their electric=\r\nity.\"\r\n\r\nI would propose to not hard code the definition for \"Renewable Energy\" into=\r\n the \"Master Agreement\" but rather define \"Renewable Energy\" for each \"Tran=\r\nsaction Agreement\" under the Master Agreement\".  For the \"Master Agreement\"=\r\n delete the definition of \"Renewable Energy\" and replace with the following=\r\n:  \"Renewable Energy\" shall have the meaning ascribed in the Transaction Ag=\r\nreement to this Master Agreement.\"=20\r\n\r\nI would propose that the definition of \"Renewable Energy\" for purposes of t=\r\nhe Transaction Agreement relative to Kinko's Texas Sites should be the foll=\r\nowing:  \"Renewable Energy\" means renewable energy credit which represents r=\r\nenewable energy that is physically metered and verified in the State of Tex=\r\nas.  Renewable energy credits in the State of Texas are derived from techno=\r\nlogy that exclusively relies on an energy source that is naturally regenera=\r\nted over a short time and derived directly from the sun, indirectly from th=\r\ne sun, or from moving water or other natural movements and mechanisms of th=\r\ne environment and include the following:  sun, wind, geothermal, hydroelect=\r\nric, wave or tidal energy, biomass or biomass waste products, including lan=\r\ndfill gas, and any other source that does ont rely on energy resources deri=\r\nved from fossil fuels, waste products from fossil fuels, or waste products =\r\nfrom inorganic sources.  For purpose of this Transaction Agreement EESI wil=\r\nl fulfill the renewable energy requirement  exclusively from one hundred pe=\r\nrcent (100%) wind sources generated within the State of Texas and verified =\r\nthrough the Texas Renewable Energy Credit Program Administrato\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom:=09Stacey Bolton/ENRON@enronXgate on 08/17/2001 08:11 AM\r\nTo:=09Richard Ring/HOU/EES@EES\r\ncc:=09=20\r\nSubject:=09RE: CA emissions factor\r\n\r\nMany thanks.

On April 1, we est=\r\nablished the Renewable Power Desk under the umbrella of West Power Trading =\r\nand West Origination here in Portland. The Desk was established to apply En=\r\nron's power marketing and development expertise to the growing market for g=\r\nreen power in the WSCC.

My understanding is that surpri=\r\nsingly some of the money that we've already submitted has been paid due (de=\r\nspite the fund being depleted) to overpayment/accounting issues with other =\r\nentities.  This also has to do w/ the time lapse between filing for reimbur=\r\nsement for 3 months prior (i.e. I don't think Richard anticipated getting p=\r\naid for some of January's purchases because technically the fund ran out in=\r\n December).

Unfortunately it wasn't what =\r\nwe wanted to hear.\r\n\r\nOn the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=\r\ne turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =\r\nthey are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =\r\ncustomers received a letter letting them know about it.\r\n\r\nOn the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=\r\nommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =\r\nbeen ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=\r\n IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=\r\nously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =\r\nsubmitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=\r\nides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=\r\ntch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=\r\nhen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =\r\nde-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=\r\nann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=\r\nw contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=\r\nRed to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=\r\nrs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =\r\nour larger customers through the reps.\r\n\r\nSo - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=\r\nn annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =\r\nthey're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=\r\n .......\r\n\r\n1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=\r\non, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =\r\nPeggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.\r\n2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=\r\n as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=\r\nived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=\r\ne should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=\r\ne will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=\r\n  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =\r\ndon't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=\r\nta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=\r\nhird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20\r\n3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =\r\nas of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=\r\nIX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=\r\non.  Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know.=20\r\n4.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =\r\nthose given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =\r\nis impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolto=\r\nn, Stacey]   We should discuss this a bit.  I'm not sure that this will rea=\r\nlly matter at the end of the day.  The CEC has instructed us all along to s=\r\nend labels to the customers, which we have.  We'll report the purchases (br=\r\nown and green) as normal at the end of the year.=20\r\n\r\nLet me know your input.\r\n\r\nHeather\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<Embedded StdOleLink>\r\n<Embedded StdOleLink>","content":"\nShe has, but I have yet to see a draft.

As it is our understanding that the direct marketing campa=\r\nign will target small commercial customers, we have drafted the direct mini=\r\n form, terms of service, and disclosure label with that customer class in m=\r\nind.\r\n\r\n* We've left the requirement of concurrent execution of the customer author=\r\nization form in Section 2.1(i) and Section 3 unchanged although the Rules o=\r\nnly require that this document be obtained prior to initiating service . Se=\r\ne WCMR 65-407-305(4)(D)(2)(a).  As the goal of the direct marketing campaig=\r\nn is to simultaneously obtain an executed agreement and customer authorizat=\r\nion form, we believe this is a clean way to manage the administration of do=\r\ncuments and avoid confusion.\r\n\r\n* On a similar note, and as discussed in connection with the MA direct mini=\r\n form, we've drafted the five day customer rescission period in Section 3 t=\r\no run from the execution of the agreement, with a notation that the terms o=\r\nf service and disclosure label are provided concurrently with the agreement=\r\n.  The Rules, however, provide that the rescission period runs five busines=\r\ns days from the customer's receipt of the terms and service summary which m=\r\nust be received by the customer 30 days following execution of the agreemen=\r\nt.  (i.e. the MPUC envisions (i) the execution of the contract, (ii) a time=\r\n passage of up to 30 days; (iii) the delivery of the terms of service summa=\r\nry and disclosure label to the customer, followed by (iv) a five business d=\r\nay right of rescission running from that date of the customer's receipt of =\r\nthe terms of service and disclosure label) See WCMR 65-407-305(4)(C).  As d=\r\niscussed in connection with the TX direct mini form, we believe many commis=\r\nsions, including the PUCT and MPUC, envision the terms of service document =\r\nto behave and function more in the manner of how we would typically conside=\r\nr a contract to behave and function.  Our thought process in drafting the r=\r\nescission period in the ME form to run from the execution of the agreement =\r\nis provide a clean way for EESI to manage the administration of the documen=\r\nts due to the unique mechanics of the transaction (the simultaneous deliver=\r\ny of the agreement, terms of service, disclosure label and customer authori=\r\nzation statement by the sales rep to the customer followed by the immediate=\r\n execution of the agreement and customer authorization statement).  We want=\r\ned to point out that as drafted, however, this provision is technically inc=\r\nonsistent with the Rules.\r\n\r\n*  To provide uniformity across forms, we have not changed the language und=\r\ner 2.6 Security which provides that EESI may request security \" as provided=\r\n in the Rules\"   We wanted to point out, however, that the ME Rules do not =\r\nrestrict the amount of deposits required by competitive electricity provide=\r\nrs (CEPs).\r\n\r\n* We've revised Section 3 \"Your Signature and Notices\" and the Representati=\r\nons and Warranties section under the GT&Cs to model the ME Rules by deletin=\r\ng references to \"Your Rights as a Customer Statement\" (a document unique to=\r\n Texas) and changed references to \"electricity facts label\" to \"disclosure =\r\nlabel\" (ME's description of the label, as opposed to TX's).\r\n\r\n* The ME Rules require a 30 day notice to the customer in the event of term=\r\nination due to the customer's default.  See WCMR 65-407-305(4)(G)(1).  We'v=\r\ne updated the \"Default and Early Termination\" section of the GT&Cs to refle=\r\nct this requirement.\r\n\r\n* By obtaining a license as a CEP in ME, EESI thereby agrees to (i) submit =\r\nto jurisdiction in the courts of the state of Maine; (ii) that all legal pr=\r\noceedings relating to disputes will be maintained in ME courts or before ME=\r\n administrative agencies; and (iii) that all contracts for generation servi=\r\nce in ME with a demand of 100 kW or less will be interpreted according to M=\r\nE law.  See WCMR 65-407-305(2)(B)(8)  We've updated the governing law provi=\r\nsion to reflect Maine jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nTerms of Service\r\n\r\nAs discussed, the Maine Rules were modeled after the Massachusetts Rules an=\r\nd many items, such as the terms of service summary and disclosure label, ar=\r\ne practically identical in format and content.  As such, we've modeled the =\r\nME terms of service summary and disclosure label after the documents provid=\r\ned in MA, with a few notable exceptions:\r\n\r\n* The ME Rules require a listing in the terms of service summary of \"condit=\r\nions under which a credit reporting agency is contacted for an applicant's =\r\ncredit history or under which the Competitive Supplier reports the customer=\r\n's payment history to a credit reporting agency\".  See WCMR 65-407-306(2)(D=\r\n)(2)(d).  Under \"Credit Information\", we've provided general information th=\r\nat the agreement will not be effective unless and until the credit standard=\r\ns established by EESI are met, that it is EESI's practice to perform credit=\r\n checks on all applicants whereby EESI may contact a credit reporting agenc=\r\ny to obtain the customer's credit history, and that in the event of nonpaym=\r\nent under the Agreement, it is possible that EESI would report such nonpaym=\r\nent to a credit reporting agency.\r\n\r\n* The Rules do not restrict the amounts of deposits nor is the CEP required=\r\n to pay any interest on deposit in ME.  The terms of service, however, requ=\r\nires the CEP to notify the customer as to deposit requirements and interest=\r\n on deposits (most likely as a measure for the customer to compare services=\r\n offered by competing CEPs). See WCMR 65-407-306(2)(D)(2)(e).  As currently=\r\n drafted, the terms of service provides that security deposits may be requi=\r\nred and interest will not be paid to the customer if such a deposit is obta=\r\nined.\r\n\r\n* The Rules require that the terms of service, if applicable, notify the cu=\r\nstomer of the CEPs ability to assign the agreement to another CEP without t=\r\nhe customer's consent. See WCMR 65-407-306(2)(D)(2)(m).  We've provided und=\r\ner \"Assignment\" that EESI will notify the customer in the event of an assig=\r\nnment which in any way affects the customer's rights and obligations under =\r\nthe agreement.\r\n\r\n* The Rules require the terms of service document to conspicuously disclose=\r\n the customer's right of rescission and how it may be exercised. See WCMR 6=\r\n5-407-306(2)(D)(2)(i).  We've drafted the \"Information on Rescission Rights=\r\n\" section with a box around it to satisfy the requirement that the disclosu=\r\nre be conspicuous.\r\n\r\n* Please note that the Rules require the terms of service to list, and we h=\r\nave left brackets around, the toll free number and hours that a customer ca=\r\nn contact the CEP for customer questions and complaints. See WCMR 65-407-30=\r\n6(2)(D)(2)(j)\r\n\r\nDisclosure Label\r\n\r\n* As the ME label is almost identical to the MA disclosure label, we've mad=\r\ne similar changes to convert the label to a fixed price rather than variabl=\r\ne price product.. Heather Mathis is coordinating with the commercial team t=\r\no verify the accuracy of the data (esp. the avg price per kWh of 5.08 cents=\r\n).  As discussed with Heather, please note that EESI must file all new prod=\r\nuct labels with the MPUC. See WCMR 65-407-306(3)(D).  The Rules are silent =\r\nas to the timing of this filing and it is unclear whether the filing must b=\r\ne made prior to or concurrently with the distribution of the new label to c=\r\nustomers.  Please let me know if you would like us to seek clarification on=\r\n this point.\r\n\r\nCustomer Authorization Statement\r\n\r\nThe Rules regarding the content of the customer authorization statement are=\r\n identical to the MA Rules and, as such, we have modeled the ME form after =\r\nMA.  The only change is the correction of the rule referenced in the openin=\r\ng sentence of the letter.  Although, as we may have discussed, the referenc=\r\ne to such rule is not a requirement and is therefore probably not essential=\r\n in either the MA or ME forms, we've left the reference in for uniformity's=\r\n sake.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about the attached or would like to discuss furth=\r\ner, please give me a call.\r\n\r\nSC\r\n\r\n\r\nSandy Cofer\r\nLeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, LLP\r\n1000 Louisiana, Suite 1400\r\nHouston, Texas 77002\r\ndirect dial: 713.287.2002\r\nfax: 713.287.2100\r\ncell: 713.416.7486\r\n\r\n\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D\r\nThis e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidenti=\r\nal and may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

On April 1, we est=\r\nablished the Renewable Power Desk under the umbrella of West Power Trading =\r\nand West Origination here in Portland. The Desk was established to apply En=\r\nron's power marketing and development expertise to the growing market for g=\r\nreen power in the WSCC. Within 6 weeks we closed our first deal (a five yea=\r\nr fixed-price sale of energy and renewable energy credits worth several mil=\r\nlion dollars) and I am very excited about the opportunities in this market =\r\nnationwide. I've spent a lot of time during the last several months establi=\r\nshing contacts with the key developers and marketers in the renewable power=\r\n market, and Stacey Bolton of Enron's Environmental Strategies Group has ga=\r\nrnered a very solid understanding of the regulatory environment and supply/=\r\ndemand dynamics in markets across the country. When you combine Enron's ski=\r\nlls in the wholesale market with our huge customer base at EES and the incr=\r\neasing level of green power committments in the public and private sectors,=\r\n it becomes readily apparent that Enron is poised to be a major player and =\r\nmarket-maker in the renewable power sector.\r\n\r\nI would like to meet with you and other representatives of Enron's trading =\r\nand origination groups on Thursday, August 16 from 12-3 to discuss a coordi=\r\nnated commercial response to the renewable power market on a nationwide bas=\r\nis.  Lunch will be served. Please let Stacey or me know ASAP if you or a de=\r\nsignate from your group will be able to attend.

On April 1, we est=\r\nablished the Renewable Power Desk under the umbrella of West Power Trading =\r\nand West Origination here in Portland. The Desk was established to apply En=\r\nron's power marketing and development expertise to the growing market for g=\r\nreen power in the WSCC. Within 6 weeks we closed our first deal (a five yea=\r\nr fixed-price sale of energy and renewable energy credits worth several mil=\r\nlion dollars) and I am very excited about the opportunities in this market =\r\nnationwide. I've spent a lot of time during the last several months establi=\r\nshing contacts with the key developers and marketers in the renewable power=\r\n market, and Stacey Bolton of Enron's Environmental Strategies Group has ga=\r\nrnered a very solid understanding of the regulatory environment and supply/=\r\ndemand dynamics in markets across the country. When you combine Enron's ski=\r\nlls in the wholesale market with our huge customer base at EES and the incr=\r\neasing level of green power committments in the public and private sectors,=\r\n it becomes readily apparent that Enron is poised to be a major player and =\r\nmarket-maker in the renewable power sector.\r\n\r\nI would like to meet with you and other representatives of Enron's trading =\r\nand origination groups on Thursday, August 16 from 12-3 to discuss a coordi=\r\nnated commercial response to the renewable power market on a nationwide bas=\r\nis.  Lunch will be served. Please let Stacey or me know ASAP if you or a de=\r\nsignate from your group will be able to attend.  We will contact you with a=\r\n follow-up call/e-mail the week of August 6th with a room location and agen=\r\nda, and hope you will be able to attend.\r\n=20\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nElliot=20\r\n\r\n\r\nElliot Mainzer\r\nRenewable Power Desk\r\nEnron North America\r\n121 SW Salmon St.\r\n3WTC-0306\r\nPortland, OR  97201\r\n(503) 464-3706\r\n(503) 464-3740 (FX)\r\n(503) 709-6959 (CL)","messageId":"<10330121.1075858659602.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-08-10T05:20:00+05:30","from":"stacey.bolton@enron.com","subject":"FW: Renewable Orig/Trading Opportunities Mtg","cc":"w.duran@enron.com, steven.kean@enron.com, jeffrey.keeler@enron.com, ","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"quoted-printable","bcc":"w.duran@enron.com, steven.kean@enron.com, jeffrey.keeler@enron.com, ","xFrom":"Stacey Bolton <Stacey Bolton/ENRON@enronXgate@ENRON>","xTo":"Ben Jacoby <Ben Jacoby/ENRON@enronXgate>, Edward D Baughman <Edward D Baughman/ENRON@enronXgate>, John Llodra <John Llodra/ENRON@enronXgate>, Heather Kroll <Heather Kroll/ENRON@enronXgate>, Drew Tingleaf <Drew Tingleaf/ENRON@enronXgate>, Jim Meyn <Jim Meyn/ENRON@enronXgate>, Kevin M Presto <Kevin M Presto/ENRON@enronXgate>, Fletcher J Sturm <Fletcher J Sturm/ENRON@enronXgate>, Dana Davis <Dana Davis/ENRON@enronXgate>, Mike Carson <Mike Carson/ENRON@enronXgate>, Doug Gilbert-Smith <Doug Gilbert-Smith/ENRON@enronXgate>, Rogers Herndon <Rogers Herndon/ENRON@enronXgate>, Richard Ring <Richard Ring/HOU/EES@EES>, Lloyd Will <Lloyd Will/ENRON@enronXgate>, John Massey <John Massey/ENRON@enronXgate>, Trevor Woods <Trevor Woods/ENRON@enronXgate>, Jeff Ader <Jeff Ader/HOU/EES@EES>, Mark Bernstein <Mark Bernstein/HOU/EES@EES>, Pearce W Hammond <Pearce W Hammond/HOU/EES@EES>, Michael Brown <Michael Brown/HOU/EES@EES>, Eitan Bernstein <Eitan Bernstein/HOU/EES@EES>, Maria Tefel <Maria Tefel/HOU/EES@EES>, Heather Mitchell <Heather Mitchell/HOU/EES@EES>, Jeremy Blachman <Jeremy Blachman/HOU/EES@EES>, James W Lewis <James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES>, Ken Gustafson <Ken Gustafson/HOU/EES@EES>, Sean A Holmes <Sean A Holmes/HOU/EES@EES>, Mark Palmer <Mark Palmer/ENRON@enronXgate>, James D Steffes <James D Steffes/ENRON@enronXgate>, Michael Terraso <Michael Terraso/ENRON@enronXgate>, Mike Curry <Mike Curry/ENRON@enronXgate>, Michael Payne <Michael Payne/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENt>, Dennis Benevides <Dennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES>, george.woods@enron.com@SMTP <george.woods@enron.com@SMTP@enronXgate>, Jennifer Thome <Jennifer Thome/ENRON@enronXgate>, Kay Quigley <Kay Quigley/HOU/EES@EES>, Dan Badger <Dan Badger/Enron@EUEnronXGate>, Dave Roberts <Dave Roberts/HOU/EES@EES>","xCc":"W David Duran <W David Duran/ENRON@enronXgate>, Steven J Kean <Steven J Kean/ENRON@enronXgate>, Jeffrey Keeler <Jeffrey Keeler/Corp/Enron@ENRON>, Mary Schoen <Mary Schoen/ENRON@enronXgate>, Lisa Jacobson <Lisa Jacobson/ENRON@enronXgate>, Tim Belden <Tim Belden/ENRON@enronXgate>, Christopher F Calger <Christopher F Calger/ENRON@enronXgate>, Elliot Mainzer <Elliot Mainzer/ENRON@enronXgate>","xFolder":"\\RRING (Non-Privileged)\\EESIRenewableEnergy","xOrigin":"Ring-R","xFileName":"RRING (Non-Privileged)1.pst","to":"ben.jacoby@enron.com,edward.baughman@enron.com,john.llodra@enron.com,heather.kroll@enron.com,drew.tingleaf@enron.com,jim.meyn@enron.com,kevin.presto@enron.com,fletcher.sturm@enron.com,dana.davis@enron.com,mike.carson@enron.com,doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com,rogers.herndon@enron.com,richard.ring@enron.com,lloyd.will@enron.com,john.massey@enron.com,trevor.woods@enron.com,jeff.ader@enron.com,mark.bernstein@enron.com,pearce.hammond@enron.com,michael.brown@enron.com,eitan.bernstein@enron.com,maria.tefel@enron.com,heather.mitchell@enron.com,jeremy.blachman@enron.com,james.lewis@enron.com,ken.gustafson@enron.com,sean.holmes@enron.com,mark.palmer@enron.com,james.steffes@enron.com,michael.terraso@enron.com,mike.curry@enron.com,michael.payne@enron.com,dennis.benevides@enron.com,george.woods@enron.com,jennifer.thome@enron.com,kay.quigley@enron.com,dan.badger@enron.com,dave.roberts@enron.com"}

Unfortunately it wasn't what =\r\nwe wanted to hear.\r\n\r\nOn the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=\r\ne turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =\r\nthey are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =\r\ncustomers received a letter letting them know about it.\r\n\r\nOn the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=\r\nommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =\r\nbeen ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=\r\n IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=\r\nously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =\r\nsubmitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=\r\nides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=\r\ntch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=\r\nhen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =\r\nde-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=\r\nann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=\r\nw contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=\r\nRed to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=\r\nrs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =\r\nour larger customers through the reps.\r\n\r\nSo - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=\r\nn annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =\r\nthey're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=\r\n .......\r\n\r\n1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=\r\non, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =\r\nPeggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.\r\n2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=\r\n as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=\r\nived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=\r\ne should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=\r\ne will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=\r\n  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =\r\ndon't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=\r\nta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=\r\nhird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20\r\n3.

Unfortunately it wasn't what =\r\nwe wanted to hear.\r\n\r\nOn the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=\r\ne turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =\r\nthey are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =\r\ncustomers received a letter letting them know about it.\r\n\r\nOn the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=\r\nommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =\r\nbeen ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=\r\n IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=\r\nously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =\r\nsubmitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=\r\nides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=\r\ntch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=\r\nhen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =\r\nde-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=\r\nann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=\r\nw contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=\r\nRed to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=\r\nrs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =\r\nour larger customers through the reps.\r\n\r\nSo - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=\r\nn annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =\r\nthey're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=\r\n .......\r\n\r\n1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=\r\non, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =\r\nPeggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.\r\n2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=\r\n as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=\r\nived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=\r\ne should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=\r\ne will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=\r\n  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =\r\ndon't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=\r\nta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=\r\nhird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20\r\n3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =\r\nas of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=\r\nIX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=\r\non.  Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know.=20\r\n4.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =\r\nthose given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =\r\nis impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolto=\r\nn, Stacey]   We should discuss this a bit.  I'm not sure that this will rea=\r\nlly matter at the end of the day.  The CEC has instructed us all along to s=\r\nend labels to the customers, which we have.

Hope I see you on Monday.  My understanding is that surpri=\r\nsingly some of the money that we've already submitted has been paid due (de=\r\nspite the fund being depleted) to overpayment/accounting issues with other =\r\nentities.  This also has to do w/ the time lapse between filing for reimbur=\r\nsement for 3 months prior (i.e. I don't think Richard anticipated getting p=\r\naid for some of January's purchases because technically the fund ran out in=\r\n December).  There is definitely not enough money to continue buying going =\r\nforward in the C&I fund.  It might be replenished next January provided dir=\r\nect access goes through. =20\r\n -----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: =09Castano, Marianne =20\r\nSent:=09Thursday, August 02, 2001 11:44 AM\r\nTo:=09Bolton, Stacey\r\nCc:=09Ring, Richard; Mathis, Heather\r\nSubject:=09RE: CA BIZMIX Issues\r\n\r\nThanks, Stacey.

To continue the Bizmix product, we wo=\r\nuld need the customer credit monies.  The customer credit monies for the Bi=\r\nzmix were depleted in January.

Unfortunately it wasn't what =\r\nwe wanted to hear.\r\n\r\nOn the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=\r\ne turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =\r\nthey are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =\r\ncustomers received a letter letting them know about it.\r\n\r\nOn the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=\r\nommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =\r\nbeen ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.

All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =\r\nsubmitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=\r\nides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.

On April 1, we est=\r\nablished the Renewable Power Desk under the umbrella of West Power Trading =\r\nand West Origination here in Portland. The Desk was established to apply En=\r\nron's power marketing and development expertise to the growing market for g=\r\nreen power in the WSCC. Within 6 weeks we closed our first deal (a five yea=\r\nr fixed-price sale of energy and renewable energy credits worth several mil=\r\nlion dollars) and I am very excited about the opportunities in this market =\r\nnationwide. I've spent a lot of time during the last several months establi=\r\nshing contacts with the key developers and marketers in the renewable power=\r\n market, and Stacey Bolton of Enron's Environmental Strategies Group has ga=\r\nrnered a very solid understanding of the regulatory environment and supply/=\r\ndemand dynamics in markets across the country. When you combine Enron's ski=\r\nlls in the wholesale market with our huge customer base at EES and the incr=\r\neasing level of green power committments in the public and private sectors,=\r\n it becomes readily apparent that Enron is poised to be a major player and =\r\nmarket-maker in the renewable power sector.\r\n\r\nI would like to meet with you and other representatives of Enron's trading =\r\nand origination groups on Thursday, August 16 from 12-3 to discuss a coordi=\r\nnated commercial response to the renewable power market on a nationwide bas=\r\nis.

On April 1, we est=\r\nablished the Renewable Power Desk under the umbrella of West Power Trading =\r\nand West Origination here in Portland. The Desk was established to apply En=\r\nron's power marketing and development expertise to the growing market for g=\r\nreen power in the WSCC. Within 6 weeks we closed our first deal (a five yea=\r\nr fixed-price sale of energy and renewable energy credits worth several mil=\r\nlion dollars) and I am very excited about the opportunities in this market =\r\nnationwide. I've spent a lot of time during the last several months establi=\r\nshing contacts with the key developers and marketers in the renewable power=\r\n market, and Stacey Bolton of Enron's Environmental Strategies Group has ga=\r\nrnered a very solid understanding of the regulatory environment and supply/=\r\ndemand dynamics in markets across the country. When you combine Enron's ski=\r\nlls in the wholesale market with our huge customer base at EES and the incr=\r\neasing level of green power committments in the public and private sectors,=\r\n it becomes readily apparent that Enron is poised to be a major player and =\r\nmarket-maker in the renewable power sector.\r\n\r\nI would like to meet with you and other representatives of Enron's trading =\r\nand origination groups on Thursday, August 16 from 12-3 to discuss a coordi=\r\nnated commercial response to the renewable power market on a nationwide bas=\r\nis.  Lunch will be served. Please let Stacey or me know ASAP if you or a de=\r\nsignate from your group will be able to attend.

An NRC panel examined\n17 energy efficiency projects that represented $1.6 billion in\nfederal investment, or roughly 20 percent of the $7.3 billion\nthat DOE has spent over the past 22 years. The panel\nestimates that the $1.6 billion investment yielded net\neconomic benefits of $30 billion.\n\nIncredibly, three DOE projects that cost only $11 million\nresulted in most of the economic benefit: compressors for\nrefrigerators and freezers, energy-efficient fluorescent-\nlighting components called electronic ballasts, and low-\nemission (low-e) window glass that resists the transmission\nof heat through windows. The NRC also credits federal\nstandards and regulations that incorporated the efficiencies\nattainable by these new technologies, ensuring that the\ntechnologies would be adopted nationwide.\n\nAs part of the report, the panel also examined federal\ninvestments in fossil energy research and development. For\n22 projects costing $11 billion -- about 73 percent of the\n$15 billion spent over 22 years -- the NRC estimates net\neconomic benefits of $10.8 billion. See the July 17th press\nrelease on the National Academies Web site at:\n<http://nationalacademies.org/topnews/>.\n\nSee also the full report -- especially the executive\nSummary -- on the National Academy Press Web site at:\n<http://www.nap.edu/books/0309074487/html/>.\n\n\nCompany Builds First 5,000-Horsepower HTS Motor\n\nAmerican Superconductor Corporation has built the first\n5,000-horsepower motor that uses high-temperature\nsuperconducting (HTS) wires in its rotor, the company\nannounced last week. Because HTS wires carry large\namounts of electrical current with low energy losses, the\nHTS motor is roughly half the size and weight of a\nconventional motor, and also reduces the energy losses by\nup to 50 percent. According to the company, motors greater\nthan 1,000 horsepower in size use one-quarter of the\nelectricity generated in the United States, so the potential\nenergy savings from large HTS motors could be significant.\nSee the American Superconductor Web site at:\nhttp://www.amsuper.com/5000htsmotor.htm>.\n\n\nHonda, BMW Start Up Hydrogen Fueling Stations\n\nAmerican Honda Motor Co., Inc. announced in early July the\nstartup of a hydrogen fueling station for its fuel-cell-powered\nvehicles. Located at Honda's research and development\ncenter in Torrance, California, the station uses solar power\nto extract hydrogen from water.

An NRC panel examined\n17 energy efficiency projects that represented $1.6 billion in\nfederal investment, or roughly 20 percent of the $7.3 billion\nthat DOE has spent over the past 22 years. The panel\nestimates that the $1.6 billion investment yielded net\neconomic benefits of $30 billion.\n\nIncredibly, three DOE projects that cost only $11 million\nresulted in most of the economic benefit: compressors for\nrefrigerators and freezers, energy-efficient fluorescent-\nlighting components called electronic ballasts, and low-\nemission (low-e) window glass that resists the transmission\nof heat through windows. The NRC also credits federal\nstandards and regulations that incorporated the efficiencies\nattainable by these new technologies, ensuring that the\ntechnologies would be adopted nationwide.\n\nAs part of the report, the panel also examined federal\ninvestments in fossil energy research and development. For\n22 projects costing $11 billion -- about 73 percent of the\n$15 billion spent over 22 years -- the NRC estimates net\neconomic benefits of $10.8 billion. See the July 17th press\nrelease on the National Academies Web site at:\n<http://nationalacademies.org/topnews/>.\n\nSee also the full report -- especially the executive\nSummary -- on the National Academy Press Web site at:\n<http://www.nap.edu/books/0309074487/html/>.\n\n\nCompany Builds First 5,000-Horsepower HTS Motor\n\nAmerican Superconductor Corporation has built the first\n5,000-horsepower motor that uses high-temperature\nsuperconducting (HTS) wires in its rotor, the company\nannounced last week. Because HTS wires carry large\namounts of electrical current with low energy losses, the\nHTS motor is roughly half the size and weight of a\nconventional motor, and also reduces the energy losses by\nup to 50 percent. According to the company, motors greater\nthan 1,000 horsepower in size use one-quarter of the\nelectricity generated in the United States, so the potential\nenergy savings from large HTS motors could be significant.\nSee the American Superconductor Web site at:\nhttp://www.amsuper.com/5000htsmotor.htm>.\n\n\nHonda, BMW Start Up Hydrogen Fueling Stations\n\nAmerican Honda Motor Co., Inc. announced in early July the\nstartup of a hydrogen fueling station for its fuel-cell-powered\nvehicles. Located at Honda's research and development\ncenter in Torrance, California, the station uses solar power\nto extract hydrogen from water. The solar panels on the\nstation generate enough hydrogen to power one fuel-cell\nvehicle, but additional electrical power from the power grid is\nused to increase the hydrogen production capacity. The new\nstation will support Honda's fuel cell vehicle development\nprogram and will be used for hydrogen production, storage\nand fueling.

Our stated coalition goal going in to the meeting was to ensure the recognition of certificates (or financial commodities representing the attributes of energy) and capability with system New England is developing.  While phase I will not meet either goal, PJM readily admits that there are adaptations that need to be made to the system that meet our goals for Phase II of the program.  To this end, a users' group was establish.  I've listed highlights of the meeting and next steps below.   The formation of this group is a VERY positive step in moving toward a system that will most effectively meet our goals.  Finally, I'm attaching a list of the meeting attendees.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I'm encouraged by these developments, and once again would like to thank all of you for your support and teamwork on this crucial issue to all of our companies/organizations.\n \nHighlights of Meeting:\n\nRegulatory update: Regulators all expressed interest in hearing from stakeholders on Phase II of PJM GATS system.  In particular, Linda Nowiki from NJ BPU noted that because of the considerable change of the Board composition since the adoption of the disclosure rules, the upcoming expansion to 5 Commissioners and a likely new Board President, and the RTO proceedings that they were particularly interested in stakeholder feedback for the GATS system.\n\nPhase I: operational by end of year and will produce company labels comprised of an aggregation of the load purchased.  Phase I is based on a mathematical formula, and will aggregate all fuel sources by company (not product).  The limitations include: an inability to carve out dedicated resources (such as a specific hydro purchase from a company's system); the inability to get to the plant level detail (unit only); the inability to segment the company fuel and emissions label into products; the emissions data (taken from EGrid) being dated and not accommodating recent emissions reductions based on retrofits or installed control technologies; and the inability to distinguish whether the unit meets class I or class II RPS.  PJM plans to distribute the first set of labels to LSEs and regulators, but realizes the data on the labels (due to the inabilities) will not be useful.\n\nPhase II: John Dadorian, project lead for GATS program, has toyed with several conceptual ideas for Phase II.  The goal is to have the system operational by March '03 -- in time for the label distribution period for both NJ and MD.  John wants Phase II to be web-based, with suppliers/generators/marketers having access to their data.   John had one scenario that he presented whereby PJM would track, by contract path, the fuel and emissions mix of suppliers.  After a specified time period, PJM would submit preliminary labels to suppliers.  Suppliers would then have a choice of modifying their label based on trading attributes.  PJM has not made any decisions about Phase II and is looking to members for comment.  to this end, they suggested forming a user's group.\n\nFormation of a user's group to address Phase II Conceptual Design and Implementation:  Enron, PG&E NEG, Hydro Quebec, PSEG and New Power made up the 5 needed members to start the group.  The user's group is NOT limited to PJM members, and a sign up sheet was distributed.  This user's group will be announced at the next PJM meeting on November 12th.  The first meeting of our user's group will be held in Wilmington, DE on Thursday 11/15.  Details will be circulated.\n\n Comment Period:  Comments are due by October 19th to John Dadorian on Phase I.  Since these labels are basically not going to have any \"purpose\" because the data will be useless, I don't know if it's worth the effort to submit comments.  I think our focus should be on Phase II.  Please let me know your thoughts.\n\n \nNEXT STEPS:\nWhile it is VERY positive that we have formed a user's group to vet these issues, it's clear that we still have considerable work to do.  Denise Foster from PJM will be establishing a list serve for us to circulate ideas/issues/concerns prior to the meeting.

The wind projects are located in four sites in Kern county and one each in Alameda,\nPalm Springs and Solano Counties.\n\nTarget on-line dates for the new plants range from February to December of next year.\n\n\"These new projects represent an important step towards Governor Davis' goal to increase California's yield of electricity from renewables from 12\npercent today to 17 percent by 2006,\" said Commissioner Michal (spelling correct) Moore. \"We're very pleased that this auction was a success,\" said\nMoore, the chair of the Commission's Electricity and Natural Gas Committee.\n\nThe auction was the third of its kind conducted by the Commission's Renewable Energy Program. Successful bidders will receive incentive payments\nof up to 1.5 cents for every kilowatt-hour of renewable electricity they generate, and incentives are paid for the first five years of project operation.\n\nAs in the two previous actions, bidders submitted the cents per kilowatt-hour incentive they wished to receive, along with an estimate of their first five\nyears of generation. To qualify for funding, projects had to be located in California and produce renewable electricity for sale, not just for on-site use.\nBids were accepted from the lowest incentive to the highest, until the available funds were exhausted.\n\nPrevious auctions held in June 1998 and November 2000 resulted in awards of more than $200 million for 1000 megawatts of new renewable\ngenerating capacity.

The wind projects are located in four sites in Kern county and one each in Alameda,\nPalm Springs and Solano Counties.\n\nTarget on-line dates for the new plants range from February to December of next year.\n\n\"These new projects represent an important step towards Governor Davis' goal to increase California's yield of electricity from renewables from 12\npercent today to 17 percent by 2006,\" said Commissioner Michal (spelling correct) Moore. \"We're very pleased that this auction was a success,\" said\nMoore, the chair of the Commission's Electricity and Natural Gas Committee.\n\nThe auction was the third of its kind conducted by the Commission's Renewable Energy Program. Successful bidders will receive incentive payments\nof up to 1.5 cents for every kilowatt-hour of renewable electricity they generate, and incentives are paid for the first five years of project operation.\n\nAs in the two previous actions, bidders submitted the cents per kilowatt-hour incentive they wished to receive, along with an estimate of their first five\nyears of generation. To qualify for funding, projects had to be located in California and produce renewable electricity for sale, not just for on-site use.\nBids were accepted from the lowest incentive to the highest, until the available funds were exhausted.\n\nPrevious auctions held in June 1998 and November 2000 resulted in awards of more than $200 million for 1000 megawatts of new renewable\ngenerating capacity. Successful projects receive production incentives for five years once they are on-line and producing electricity.\n\nEligible \"green\" technologies are biomass, digester gas, geothermal, landfill gas, photovoltaics, small hydroelectric (30 megawatts or less), solar\nthermal electric, waste tire, and wind. Of the 72 successful projects from the first two auctions, 35 projects totaling more than 200 megawatts have\nbeen completed and are delivering electricity to the grid.\n\nResults of the third auction can be found on the Commission's Web site at: www.energy.ca.gov/contracts <http://www.energy.ca.gov/contracts>.

The  Penn Quakers are buying 20 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) - the output of five  turbines or the equivalent of 5 percent of its electricity - from the Community  Energy-Exelon Power Team's 15 MW and 9 MW wind farms at Mill Run and Somerset  Township. \n \nWith these turbines only just beginning to turn, multiple  conversations were heard about the need to build even more wind farms to meet  retail consumer demand for wind energy. All those standing on the reclaimed mine  land that is now a dairy farm could see before them the merging of wind power  and the power of the retail marketplace.\n \nNot far behind the Quakers in their purchase are the roaring  Nittany Lions of Penn State University. Penn State University is purchasing more  than 13 million kWh, the production of three turbines, from Community Energy.  For a land grant university, it's hard to beat clean energy made on a dairy  farm.\n \nIn third place is Carnegie Mellon University, which created  crucial momentum by becoming the first major wind purchaser, acquiring 4.8  million kWh. Having exercised real leadership and gotten this market moving,  Carnegie Mellon is seriously considering increasing its wind energy buy next  year.\n \nRounding out the top five are the Philadelphia Suburban Water  Company and Giant Eagle, with purchases of about 4 million and 3 million kWh  respectively. \n \nWe urge more companies and utilities to follow their examples.  If you are interested in buying wind energy, contact Community Energy at  www.newwindenergy.com . \n \nIn fact, if just 660 institutions buy at least the output of  one large wind turbine, Pennsylvania's retail consumers can insure that 1,000 MW  of new wind energy are built and operating. By harnessing the power of the  retail market to wind power development, that goal is very achievable.  \n \nThough not in the top five, the Environmental Protection  Agency, Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, and the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia  have all also made major purchases. Every one of these purchasers understands  the price of wind energy, but more importantly, they understand its  environmental, public health, and energy security value, showing that Oscar  Wilde wasn't right about everyone when he said \"nowadays people know the price  of everything and the value of nothing.\"\n \nStunningly, 75 percent of the wind power from these two wind  farms was sold out as soon as Public Utility Commission Chairman Glen Thomas and  Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David Hess flipped the switch  of the first of what are sixteen Enron Wind 1.5 MW machines. \n \nThese turbines, which make 11-20 full revolutions per minute,  are the largest manufactured in the United States, and their blades are longer  than previously used to be more efficient in the moderate-but-steady wind at  these locations. All told, they will generate enough electricity for 8,000  homes, or about 63 million kWh of electricity - with no soot, mercury, carbon  dioxide, nitrogen oxide, or sulfur dioxide. In contrast, typical system power in  this region would emit about 75 million pounds of carbon dioxide, 568,000 pounds  of sulfur dioxide, and 177,000 pounds per year of nitrogen oxide in order to  provide the same amount of electricity.  \n \nBut aside from the important environmental benefits, the wind  projects also reflect substantial economic development in Fayette and Somerset  counties. Both the Mill Run and Somerset turbines are on working farms, with the  owners receiving $3,000 to $4,000 for each tower erected on their land, which  they continue to farm. Several of the Somerset turbines are situated on  reclaimed strip and deep mines. Construction of the two wind farms required  about 40 labor years of employment and will require about four full-time  equivalent workers to maintain and operate the sites. The sites generate local  property taxes and, if yesterday's dedication ceremonies and the nearby Green  Mountain wind farm in Garrett are any indication, at least a modest tourist  industry! \n \nThis was all made possible by a great project team and every  member deserves a hearty \"well done.\" Although construction only took about 4?  months, project development by Atlantic Renewable Energy Corporation began about  two years ago. Zilkha Renewable Energy, Atlantic's development partner, provided  project financing, as did The Reinvestment Fund's Sustainable Development Fund,  with money made available as a result of the PECO Energy and Unicom merger  settlement negotiated by PennFuture and others. Exelon Power Team is the  wholesaler and Community Energy markets wind energy to retail customers.   \n \nOn a sad note, Nick Humber, an Enron Wind employee who was  instrumental in moving the projects to fruition, died when his hijacked plane  crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. Another plane that crashed in  Somerset County was only about 15 miles from the wind farm. Nick's contribution  to the project leaves a stunning memorial, reaching into the sky, with clean,  affordable, home-grown electricity that supports our communities. We are glad  that Nick's brother was able to attend the dedication. \n \nAs the tragic events of Sept. 11 spur renewed patriotism and  interest in domestic safety, it is important to recognize that the Community  Energy-Exelon wind farms will help to increase America's energy independence and  security. More wind farms can only do us more good. \n \n\"Conservation is a moral issue,\" said President Teddy  Roosevelt, \"for it involves the patriotic duty to insure the safety and  continuance of the nation.\" \n \nIn these times, conservation of America's environment and  protecting the nation's safety cannot be done without an accelerated shift to  wind and other renewable energy resources. To all involved with this project,  but especially the University of Pennsylvania and the other purchasers who have  acted in keeping with Teddy Roosevelt's words, we salute  you.\n---------------------------------\nE-Cubed is available for reprint in  newspapers and other publications.

The  Penn Quakers are buying 20 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) - the output of five  turbines or the equivalent of 5 percent of its electricity - from the Community  Energy-Exelon Power Team's 15 MW and 9 MW wind farms at Mill Run and Somerset  Township. \n \nWith these turbines only just beginning to turn, multiple  conversations were heard about the need to build even more wind farms to meet  retail consumer demand for wind energy. All those standing on the reclaimed mine  land that is now a dairy farm could see before them the merging of wind power  and the power of the retail marketplace.\n \nNot far behind the Quakers in their purchase are the roaring  Nittany Lions of Penn State University. Penn State University is purchasing more  than 13 million kWh, the production of three turbines, from Community Energy.  For a land grant university, it's hard to beat clean energy made on a dairy  farm.\n \nIn third place is Carnegie Mellon University, which created  crucial momentum by becoming the first major wind purchaser, acquiring 4.8  million kWh. Having exercised real leadership and gotten this market moving,  Carnegie Mellon is seriously considering increasing its wind energy buy next  year.\n \nRounding out the top five are the Philadelphia Suburban Water  Company and Giant Eagle, with purchases of about 4 million and 3 million kWh  respectively. \n \nWe urge more companies and utilities to follow their examples.  If you are interested in buying wind energy, contact Community Energy at  www.newwindenergy.com . \n \nIn fact, if just 660 institutions buy at least the output of  one large wind turbine, Pennsylvania's retail consumers can insure that 1,000 MW  of new wind energy are built and operating. By harnessing the power of the  retail market to wind power development, that goal is very achievable.  \n \nThough not in the top five, the Environmental Protection  Agency, Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, and the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia  have all also made major purchases. Every one of these purchasers understands  the price of wind energy, but more importantly, they understand its  environmental, public health, and energy security value, showing that Oscar  Wilde wasn't right about everyone when he said \"nowadays people know the price  of everything and the value of nothing.\"\n \nStunningly, 75 percent of the wind power from these two wind  farms was sold out as soon as Public Utility Commission Chairman Glen Thomas and  Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David Hess flipped the switch  of the first of what are sixteen Enron Wind 1.5 MW machines. \n \nThese turbines, which make 11-20 full revolutions per minute,  are the largest manufactured in the United States, and their blades are longer  than previously used to be more efficient in the moderate-but-steady wind at  these locations. All told, they will generate enough electricity for 8,000  homes, or about 63 million kWh of electricity - with no soot, mercury, carbon  dioxide, nitrogen oxide, or sulfur dioxide. In contrast, typical system power in  this region would emit about 75 million pounds of carbon dioxide, 568,000 pounds  of sulfur dioxide, and 177,000 pounds per year of nitrogen oxide in order to  provide the same amount of electricity.  \n \nBut aside from the important environmental benefits, the wind  projects also reflect substantial economic development in Fayette and Somerset  counties. Both the Mill Run and Somerset turbines are on working farms, with the  owners receiving $3,000 to $4,000 for each tower erected on their land, which  they continue to farm. Several of the Somerset turbines are situated on  reclaimed strip and deep mines. Construction of the two wind farms required  about 40 labor years of employment and will require about four full-time  equivalent workers to maintain and operate the sites. The sites generate local  property taxes and, if yesterday's dedication ceremonies and the nearby Green  Mountain wind farm in Garrett are any indication, at least a modest tourist  industry! \n \nThis was all made possible by a great project team and every  member deserves a hearty \"well done.\" Although construction only took about 4?  months, project development by Atlantic Renewable Energy Corporation began about  two years ago. Zilkha Renewable Energy, Atlantic's development partner, provided  project financing, as did The Reinvestment Fund's Sustainable Development Fund,  with money made available as a result of the PECO Energy and Unicom merger  settlement negotiated by PennFuture and others. Exelon Power Team is the  wholesaler and Community Energy markets wind energy to retail customers.   \n \nOn a sad note, Nick Humber, an Enron Wind employee who was  instrumental in moving the projects to fruition, died when his hijacked plane  crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. Another plane that crashed in  Somerset County was only about 15 miles from the wind farm. Nick's contribution  to the project leaves a stunning memorial, reaching into the sky, with clean,  affordable, home-grown electricity that supports our communities. We are glad  that Nick's brother was able to attend the dedication. \n \nAs the tragic events of Sept. 11 spur renewed patriotism and  interest in domestic safety, it is important to recognize that the Community  Energy-Exelon wind farms will help to increase America's energy independence and  security. More wind farms can only do us more good. \n \n\"Conservation is a moral issue,\" said President Teddy  Roosevelt, \"for it involves the patriotic duty to insure the safety and  continuance of the nation.\" \n \nIn these times, conservation of America's environment and  protecting the nation's safety cannot be done without an accelerated shift to  wind and other renewable energy resources. To all involved with this project,  but especially the University of Pennsylvania and the other purchasers who have  acted in keeping with Teddy Roosevelt's words, we salute  you.\n---------------------------------\nE-Cubed is available for reprint in  newspapers and other publications.

{"rawContent":"\nWe're coming down to the final wire on the Green-eT-RECs standard.  Below i=\r\ns a synopsis of the outstanding issues.  I wanted to get your thought about=\r\n the following the options.  I agree with staff that choice #1 is ideal.  M=\r\ny second choice is #3.  The issue is this: Each of the regions has slightly=\r\n different to dramatically different definitions for eligible resources for=\r\n a Green-e certified electricity product.  In order to have a national stan=\r\ndard whereby a marketer can market the same product across the states, staf=\r\nf has proposed certifying generators per region.  These generators would be=\r\n certified according to that region's standard.  The T-RECS could then be m=\r\narketed anywhere.  Some folks want to control not only the generators that =\r\nare certified, but the products that are sold in their region.  Thus the op=\r\ntion for the highest common denominator (choice #2).  I think we need to go=\r\n with the most administratively simple method that will promote the most li=\r\nquidity.  Certifying generator or creating a separate T-RECs standard seem =\r\nto be the easiest.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts.  I'd like to get back with Meredith today.

The problem is that if we did a  highest common denom=\r\ninator standard, some renewables, namely biomass would be  excluded.  We fe=\r\nel that this would be a somewhat arbitrary exclusion  because biomass has b=\r\neen excluded from some regional standards because of  specific regional cir=\r\ncumstances and that it would not be fair to penalize the  entire biomass in=\r\ndustry by eliminating it from the T-RECs - Green-e  market.\r\n=20\r\nSo  staff have proposed a generator based sourcing standard.  Eligibility w=\r\nould thus apply to renewable  generators, not marketers.  So if a generator=\r\n qualified, they would-be  able to market their T-RECs anywhere in the US. =\r\n The general feedback I got  from you was that people didn't like this idea=\r\n because (1) it wasn't clear for  the consumer what types of eligible are a=\r\nllowed under Green-e cert.

I wanted to get your thought about=\r\n the following the options.  I agree with staff that choice #1 is ideal.  M=\r\ny second choice is #3.  The issue is this: Each of the regions has slightly=\r\n different to dramatically different definitions for eligible resources for=\r\n a Green-e certified electricity product.  In order to have a national stan=\r\ndard whereby a marketer can market the same product across the states, staf=\r\nf has proposed certifying generators per region.  These generators would be=\r\n certified according to that region's standard.  The T-RECS could then be m=\r\narketed anywhere.  Some folks want to control not only the generators that =\r\nare certified, but the products that are sold in their region.  Thus the op=\r\ntion for the highest common denominator (choice #2).  I think we need to go=\r\n with the most administratively simple method that will promote the most li=\r\nquidity.  Certifying generator or creating a separate T-RECs standard seem =\r\nto be the easiest.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts.  I'd like to get back with Meredith today.  Also=\r\n, these issues are pretty nebulous -- so call if you have ?s.\r\n\r\nStacey Bolton\r\nEnvironmental Strategies\r\nEnron Corp\r\n713-853-9916 direct=20\r\n713-303-2632 cell=20\r\nstacey.bolton@enron.com <mailto:stacey.bolton@enron.com>\r\n=20\r\n\r\n -----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: =09\"Meredith Wingate\" <mwingate@resource-solutions.org>@ENRON =20\r\nSent:=09Tuesday, November 06, 2001 4:34 PM\r\nTo:=09Anne Marie McShea; Barbara Atkinson \\(LBNL\\); Brenna Herpmann; Brent =\r\nBeerley; Jeff Schmidt; Kevin Porter; Liz Robinson; Maureen Mulligan; Mark C=\r\nrowdis; Matt Deluca; Peter Adels; Rich Travaglini; Roger Clark; Sam Swanson=\r\n; Serpil Guran; Stacey Bolton; Maryanne Daniel\r\nCc:=09Dan Lieberman; Andrew Altman; Kirk Brown\r\nSubject:=09Generator based sourcing standards\r\n\r\n\r\nFolks,=20\r\nAs you know, at our last meeting, I promised to circulate the different  op=\r\ntions we discussed on generator -based sourcing standards. =20\r\n=20\r\nThe  problem we are trying to solve is this:  We'd like to develop a nation=\r\nal  definition for \"eligible\" renewables  for certification of   T-RECs pro=\r\nducts under Green-e.  The problem is that if we did a  highest common denom=\r\ninator standard, some renewables, namely biomass would be  excluded.  We fe=\r\nel that this would be a somewhat arbitrary exclusion  because biomass has b=\r\neen excluded from some regional standards because of  specific regional cir=\r\ncumstances and that it would not be fair to penalize the  entire biomass in=\r\ndustry by eliminating it from the T-RECs - Green-e  market.\r\n=20\r\nSo  staff have proposed a generator based sourcing standard.  Eligibility w=\r\nould thus apply to renewable  generators, not marketers.  So if a generator=\r\n qualified, they would-be  able to market their T-RECs anywhere in the US. =\r\n The general feedback I got  from you was that people didn't like this idea=\r\n because (1) it wasn't clear for  the consumer what types of eligible are a=\r\nllowed under Green-e cert. (e.g.  Georgia biomass excluded, but PA biomass =\r\nallowed) and (2) effectively gave  marketers the ability to sell a type of =\r\npower into a market that might not meet  the regional definition of eligibl=\r\ne, (e.g. you could sell forestry-derived  biomass generated in New England =\r\ninto the PA market - the generator would  meet the new England definition f=\r\nor eligible and therefore would be able to sell  that power anywhere.)\r\n=20\r\nWe discussed a couple of different  options for handling this dilemma.

{"rawContent":"\nUm....yeah.\n\n\nU.S., Japan Pursuing Space-Based Solar Power Systems\n\nThe National Space Development Agency of Japan, or\nNASDA, has announced plans to develop a satellite-based\nsolar power system that would beam energy back to Earth. A\nsatellite carrying large solar panels would use a laser to\ntransmit the power to an airship at an altitude of about\n12 miles, which would then transmit the power to Earth.\nNASDA currently expects to develop the laser technologies\nin the next 10 years and aims to conduct its first power\ntransmission test in 2025. See the NASDA Web site at:\n<http://spaceboy.nasda.go.jp/note/kouso/E/kou106_solar_e.html>.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nin the United States has been pursuing a similar approach,\nalthough with less ambitious goals. A September review of\nthe NASA research by the National Research Council (NRC)\nfound the research worthwhile, although it noted that the\nfunding levels would have to be much higher to achieve its\ngoals. The review noted that \"dramatic reductions\" would be\nneeded in the cost of placing the system into Earth orbit and\nin the cost of the solar panels, and that significant progress\nis still needed in the technology to manage the power in\nspace and beam it back to Earth. See the NRC report at:\n<http://www.nap.edu/books/0309075971/html/>.\n\nThe subject of space-based power has also been examined\nby Resources for the Future (RFF), a Washington-based\ngroup that studies energy and environmental policy. A report\nissued last year suggested that space-based power would\nhave difficulty competing with land-based power sources,\nand urged that economic analyses continue in tandem with\nthe technology development. However, a more promising\navenue was suggested in an October report, which\nexamined the concept of using a space-based power plant to\nbeam power to other space-based facilities. See the\n\"Discussion Papers\" in the Space section of the RFF Library\nat: <http://www.rff.org/nat_resources/space.htm>.\n\nIf those concepts aren't far enough into outer space for you,\nconsider this: wind energy might be a great energy option on\nMars. It turns out that solar power systems, which are\nusually used for power in space, would be least effective\nduring Martian sand storms, when it's windy, of course. So a\nwind and solar hybrid energy system might work best.\nSimilar systems operating in Alaska and Antarctica may\nserve as models for these Martian power systems.

I think we should then look at the membership of several major organizations -- the Business Council on Sustainable Development, the Pew Center on Climate Change, Environmental Defense for starters, to find some other high-profile companies with a stated committment to environmental protection. \n \nJeff Shields will look at the large commercial and industrial customers targeted in Oregon as they are ENA, not EES target customers (Enron has an arbitrary SEC-code distinction for who ENA targets vs who EES targets and industrial customers are definitely ENA fodder). As for the other industrial accounts in other states, most of them are mines, aluminum smelters and that sort and are probably not our principal target audience.\n \nThx,\n \nElliot\n \n \n\n ","messageId":"<28326252.1075861005653.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-11-13T06:13:31+05:30","from":"jennifer.thome@enron.com","subject":"FW: Potential green customers","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Thome, Jennifer </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JTHOME>","xTo":"Ring, Richard </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rring>","xFolder":"\\Richard_Ring_Mar2002\\Ring, Richard\\EESIRenewableEnergy","xOrigin":"Ring-R","xFileName":"rring (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"richard.ring@enron.com"}

For the one project that has come on line during the non-performance penalty could be in the range of $150,000 to $640,000, depending on the resoultion of the \"effective online date\" for said project.  The non-performance penalty was our strongest negotiating point in the ongoing effort to restructure the agreement as there is a potential for penalties for each project for each year of the contract.  The agreement contained some fundamenal flaws in order to be able to book the mark-to-market for the agreement.  \n\nI do not have a good handle of the \"early termination payment\" except to say that there are approxmiately 390,500 MWh's.  The average contract \"fixed price\" is $33.10 MWh.  I would need to find out what the nine year fixed price from the power curves is to estimate but my best stab would be to estimate the nine year fixed price to be $25.00 MWh which would result in \"early termination payment\" of approximately $3,200,000 ((390,500*33.10) - (390,500*25.00)).\n\nRichard  \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSmith, Mike D.  \nSent:\tTuesday, January 29, 2002 3:25 PM\nTo:\tRing, Richard\nSubject:\tRE: Riverside County Waste Mgt \n\nThanks.

More\nimportantly though, without the model, there will be more wind\ncurtailments in Texas than otherwise necessary.\n\nIt will probably take at least a year from now before this model is\navailable for use.\n\nThe need for a good wind turbine generator model is a\nNational/International issue.  As such, perhaps DOE/NREL will help\npay.\n\nThis issue will start cropping up everywhere...

More\nimportantly though, without the model, there will be more wind\ncurtailments in Texas than otherwise necessary.\n\nIt will probably take at least a year from now before this model is\navailable for use.\n\nThe need for a good wind turbine generator model is a\nNational/International issue.  As such, perhaps DOE/NREL will help\npay.\n\nThis issue will start cropping up everywhere...

The report, titled \"Powering\n     Ahead,\" analyzes the economic impacts of the renewable portfolio\n     standard (RPS) in California.  Over 95 percent of California's\n     current contracts for future energy production are committed to\n     natural gas.\n\n     Although the California state assembly was expected to consider RPS\n     legislation this past week, action has been postponed until the\n     weekend when the legislators are scheduled to complete this year's\n     work.\n\n     \"California has experienced first-hand the dangers of a market\n     dominated by volatile fossil fuels,\" said UCS senior analyst and\n     report author Deborah Donovan.  \"Now we have the hard numbers to\n     prove renewable energy is beneficial for California's economic\n     health.\"\n\n     The state of Texas has implemented the most successful RPS to date,\n     where requirements for new renewable generation capacity have been\n     set high enough to create a strong market for renewable project\n     development.  Natural gas prices in California have been extremely\n     volatile with price hikes 10 to 20 times the historical average last\n     year.\n\n     However, in California the Department of Water Resources, which buys\n     power for the state, uses a formula that makes it difficult for wind\n     power to participate in the market and that has stunted investment\n     in new wind power projects.\n\n     UCS said that RPS are designed to help alleviate some of the burden\n     created by state-by-state legislation which creates hurdles for the\n     widespread adoption of renewable energies.  Additionally, RPS\n     provides for the preservation of state jurisdiction over energy\n     while making it easier for renewable energy technologies to\n     penetrate the market.\n\n     (WIND ENERGY WEEKLY: 9/14)\n\n = = = = = = =\n\n     GRANTS & CONTRACTS REPORT\n     -------------------------\n\n\n                DOE Awards Funds for Bioenergy Development\n\n     The Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced that it will\n     invest $30 million over the next three to five years in 11 projects\n     intended to develop process technology to create various products\n     using plant matter and other natural waste materials.

The market is always asking itself questions like:   S=\r\nhould I commit to a deal now or wait?  For how much and for how long should=\r\n I commit? What is the impact of this transaction on my portfolio? How do m=\r\narket events impact near, mid and long term pricing? How long will the pric=\r\ne remain at the current level?  A forward view is a prerequisite to manage =\r\nand optimize on an energy  portfolio in competitive markets. ZE PowerGroup =\r\nprovides short,  mid and long-term Forward Price Views. The Forward Price V=\r\niews are  developed using sophisticated, top-down market simulation models =\r\n that are readily customizable and adaptable in size and scope to  any regi=\r\non in North America. The Forward Price Models have been  designed using the=\r\n key drivers and fundamental parameters of the  natural gas and electrical =\r\npower industries in combination with  econometric techniques and expert jud=\r\ngment. The value of the model  is in its ability to extract and quantify th=\r\ne expert judgment.  The difference between the ZE PowerGroup Forward Price =\r\nModel and  other models is that of a top-down market simulation versus bott=\r\nom-up  generation modeling. The bottom-up generation model does not always =\r\n account for market behavior and assumes that generation is predominantly  =\r\neconomically. These modes make little or no allowance for market  power, in=\r\nefficiencies, gaming or other operational or unique market  factors.  ZE Po=\r\nwerGroup developed their first price views in 1996. The Forward  Price Mode=\r\nl has performed well as a guiding tool; the views created  from the models =\r\nhave consistently predicted the direction of price  movement in the markets=\r\n. It was one of the few models that predicted  rapid and consistent price i=\r\nncreases after deregulation when the  industry consensus was that prices wo=\r\nuld retreat. Clients who have  incorporated the price views into their stra=\r\ntegic planning have  reaped significant benefits and mitigated price risks;=\r\n fairing better  than their counterparts.  The Forward Price Model can be c=\r\noupled with the Market Monitoring  subscription, which adds value through t=\r\nargeted intelligence required  to optimize positioning in uncertain and vol=\r\natile markets.

ISO New England\nspokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its\ndefault.\n\n  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on\noccasion, Foley and Doot said.\n\n  \"I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a\nparticipant to find itself out of compliance,\" Doot said. \"Those things have\nin fact happened from time to time.\"\n\n  -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061;\nkristen.mcnamara@dowjones.com\n\n\n\nFolder Name: Enron Corp.\nRelevance Score on Scale of 100: 100\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nTo review or revise your folder, visit http://www.djinteractive.com or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

I am offering up some expanded language around the index we use so that it is more clear.  If we settle on that language, the spot energy price may need to be modified accordingly.

Now its stock is down, wall street is be=\r\narish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?\r\nby Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>\r\nTHE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=\r\ne international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=\r\n way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=\r\nompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=\r\nernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=\r\nrown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=\r\nhey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=\r\norm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=\r\nblic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=\r\ng intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=\r\nsize TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=\r\ntors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=\r\nople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=\r\npped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=\r\ns; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=\r\ninated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=\r\nting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=\r\nlevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: \"From the World's =\r\nLeading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!\"\r\nFor a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=\r\nm a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=\r\n. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=\r\ncent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=\r\nlion to $100 billion. \"The very mention of the company in energy circles th=\r\nroughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,\"=\r\n notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=\r\nrket intelligence to the energy business.\r\nThis Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=\r\nd to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=\r\ny then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =\r\nformula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =\r\nselling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=\r\nmpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=\r\n to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=\r\nnron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=\r\nation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=\r\nou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =\r\npower needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =\r\nnew and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=\r\nck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=\r\nhe company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=\r\nrld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=\r\neded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, \"was a great mar=\r\nriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=\r\nntality of the financial markets.\"\r\nThe Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=\r\nd of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=\r\n was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=\r\nan economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =\r\nculture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=\r\nhe best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=\r\no could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=\r\n the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=\r\n company couldn't possibly go wrong.\r\nOr could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =\r\n$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=\r\nrgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=\r\n his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=\r\nject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=\r\n, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=\r\nnce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=\r\nnge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=\r\ntain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=\r\nt the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.\r\nENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD \"a totally different way of thinking about b=\r\nusiness-we got it.\" At Enron, in fact, you either \"got it\" or you were gone=\r\n-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=\r\ne color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =\r\nonce headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=\r\nny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=\r\n off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=\r\nlack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=\r\nble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=\r\nling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=\r\nt six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=\r\nral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=\r\nrica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=\r\nhained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, \"someone cou=\r\nld actually get killed.\" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=\r\nistmas morning. \"I had no idea what I'd let go of,\" Skilling says of all th=\r\ne personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20\r\nFrom a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=\r\n photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=\r\nf working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=\r\ned, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=\r\ner. He almost missed his brother's wedding. \"Learning a foreign language-I =\r\nnever learned a foreign language!\" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=\r\ngest son to school. \"I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=\r\nen-minute scheduling.\" Travel: \"You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=\r\nnything out of it!\" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =\r\non his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. \"I'm not sure=\r\n that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,\" he says, finally=\r\n. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=\r\ns pragmatic edge. \"It would have been easy to stay,\" he says. \"But that wou=\r\nld not have been good for me.\"=20\r\nHe's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=\r\nsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=\r\nduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=\r\n underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=\r\neporters who have labeled his resignation \"bizarre\" and associates who are =\r\nbitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=\r\nits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=\r\n upon. \"I'm surprised,\" he says, \"that people have so much trouble understa=\r\nnding this.\"\r\nPEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=\r\nneties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=\r\nlding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=\r\no five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=\r\nine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=\r\nked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=\r\n hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=\r\nse days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=\r\nat scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =\r\nin Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=\r\n the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=\r\nuch humiliation?\r\nBut this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=\r\nes when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=\r\nas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=\r\nntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=\r\nolatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=\r\nral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=\r\ny gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=\r\n from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=\r\ns then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=\r\no chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=\r\ntoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=\r\nietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=\r\ndly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=\r\nNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=\r\ne of Texas.\r\nHNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=\r\nmpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =\r\npipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=\r\nn the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=\r\n in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =\r\nCoastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled \"the purchase\" was being call=\r\ned \"the merger\" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=\r\nly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=\r\navity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=\r\nnning a new company called Enron. \"Over time it became clear that Lay had a=\r\n better vision of the future,\" says one person associated with Enron at tha=\r\nt time. \"He never fought change. He embraced change.\"\r\nLay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=\r\n debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =\r\nexclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =\r\nnew business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=\r\ntarted.=20\r\nLIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=\r\nd spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=\r\nad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=\r\nllinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) \"I l=\r\niked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,\" he told Busines=\r\nsWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =\r\nwasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =\r\nwas anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=\r\nhat he would come to call \"intellectual capital.\" He loved being smart, and=\r\n he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=\r\nodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=\r\nk on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=\r\ns class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=\r\nup path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =\r\na business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20\r\nIt is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=\r\n, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=\r\n all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=\r\nying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=\r\none saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=\r\nhere credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=\r\n called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=\r\ne price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =\r\na broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =\r\nrisk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=\r\nestment bank would.\r\nSkilling worked up some numbers and found them \"absolutely compelling.\" The=\r\nn the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=\r\nutives. He had a one-page presentation. \"Almost to a person,\" Skilling says=\r\n, \"they thought it was stupid.\" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=\r\nected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=\r\nen said, \"Let's go.\"\r\nThe Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=\r\n cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=\r\nns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=\r\nse divides that seem to define his life: \"I believed this whole world would=\r\n be different, a huge breakthrough\" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =\r\neven if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=\r\n, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =\r\ncharacter, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=\r\n joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, \"We were in=\r\n.\" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=\r\non as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=\r\nr him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=\r\n. After that, says Skilling, \"we never looked back.\"\r\nSkilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=\r\nd a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=\r\nould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =\r\ngas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=\r\nate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=\r\nest access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =\r\nto be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=\r\netter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=\r\nake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=\r\nrice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=\r\nth startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =\r\nhave ever imagined.\r\nTHIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=\r\nade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=\r\ness. The idea was to build a \"knowledge-based business,\" which demanded a s=\r\nkill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=\r\nt were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=\r\nf them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=\r\n industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=\r\nolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =\r\nmoney-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. \"Enron was going to=\r\n create a niche for itself or die,\" one former executive explains. \"The peo=\r\nple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=\r\nrrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.\"\r\nSkilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=\r\nmartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=\r\ncause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =\r\nwanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=\r\ngest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=\r\noston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be \"a=\r\nggressive.\" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=\r\nere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20\r\nYou could see what he was looking for on \"Super Saturdays\" at the Houston h=\r\neadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=\r\nn-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=\r\n day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=\r\nbility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called \"a sense =\r\nof urgency.\" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =\r\ncandidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=\r\nhe types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =\r\nEnron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=\r\nybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =\r\nthan enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=\r\nts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=\r\ng suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)\r\nFor the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=\r\nnd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=\r\nturing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=\r\nlobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=\r\npany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=\r\n with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=\r\ne house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=\r\non never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=\r\nld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=\r\nerweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=\r\nm. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=\r\nen at night. \"They were so cutting edge,\" rhapsodizes someone involved with=\r\n the company health care program at the time. \"They really thought about th=\r\ne psychology and what it took to keep these people going.\"\r\nSkilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=\r\n, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=\r\ne titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=\r\nnd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=\r\nes-with no cap. \"If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=\r\n make a lot of money,\" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=\r\ntil resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=\r\nision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =\r\nwith two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=\r\n. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=\r\ned him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=\r\nf-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=\r\nectacular Mexican villa. \"Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=\r\nd say,\" one loyalist says.=20\r\nAnd why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=\r\nerchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=\r\nuzzword was \"aggressive,\" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=\r\nved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=\r\n Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=\r\nice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=\r\nn barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=\r\nny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=\r\nrvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=\r\ne somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=\r\nrts).\r\nBut the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=\r\nade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =\r\nthe division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=\r\ngest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=\r\nn had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=\r\n2 billion to $7 billion. \"Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=\r\n in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,\" the New =\r\nYork Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=\r\ning had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=\r\nsforming another.\r\n\"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,\"=\r\n sang the New York Times in 1999. \"In the staid world of regulated utilitie=\r\ns and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,\" crowed For=\r\ntune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=\r\ne, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=\r\n, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=\r\ncover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=\r\nel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=\r\n client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=\r\ne against the usual winter downturn?\r\nBut most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=\r\nommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=\r\ncame another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=\r\nnline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=\r\nd price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=\r\non, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=\r\ny lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=\r\nng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=\r\nt the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=\r\n deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=\r\n in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. \"Its strat=\r\negy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=\r\ndities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,\" BusinessWeek insis=\r\nted.\r\nThere was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =\r\nthe company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=\r\nustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=\r\nomers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=\r\no come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=\r\nents as customers and began calling them \"counterparties.\"\r\nSkilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=\r\naximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=\r\n overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=\r\ne quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=\r\nl-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=\r\nderwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=\r\nets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=\r\n, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=\r\nd at all.=20\r\nWhile many businesses used what was known in the industry as \"mark-to-marke=\r\nt accounting,\" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=\r\nompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=\r\n idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=\r\nt deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=\r\nnuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=\r\never many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=\r\n went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=\r\nht be something fishy about what they called \"subjective accounting,\" inves=\r\ntors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=\r\net fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=\r\nt that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =\r\ngoing to be high enough. \"Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,\" =\r\nsays one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=\r\nany could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=\r\n for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=\r\nontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=\r\nting literacy charity: \"Even the person who was supposed to give money away=\r\n for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,\" he says.\r\nAs Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =\r\ntook on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=\r\nron family put it, \"It became a company full of mercenaries.\" The change st=\r\narted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =\r\nof the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=\r\nhe commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=\r\nrhearing orders like \"I need a smart person-go buy me one\" or \"Buy me an in=\r\ntelligent slave, quick.\" Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=\r\ne sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=\r\nrody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=\r\no disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.\r\nAnd, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=\r\n. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=\r\nkilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=\r\nystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=\r\nhose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=\r\nickly became \"rank and yank.\") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=\r\nsion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=\r\niate put it, \"Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=\r\n store.\" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=\r\nn's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=\r\nitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=\r\ne, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=\r\non higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=\r\n he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=\r\nore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.\r\nEveryone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =\r\n\"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=\r\night of the future,\" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=\r\nals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=\r\nps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=\r\nn as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase \"No old tapes\" became a=\r\nn Enron clich?. \"People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,\" says=\r\n one former Enron executive.\r\nIn such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=\r\nictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=\r\n E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=\r\ne for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =\r\nbut they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=\r\ns way: \"They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=\r\nou bleed to death.\"\r\nBEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =\r\ncompany into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=\r\nust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=\r\nts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=\r\nlt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=\r\nealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=\r\non's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=\r\nojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=\r\nous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. \"It wasn't the tim=\r\ne for long-term approaches,\" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=\r\n \"It was the technology era.\"\r\nTo rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=\r\ncca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=\r\nars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=\r\nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=\r\ne requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=\r\nron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =\r\n$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=\r\nf Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=\r\ne Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =\r\ntwo appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=\r\nrate America.\r\nBut then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=\r\na, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=\r\nay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=\r\nercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=\r\nhanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=\r\ner Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=\r\n, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.\r\nForcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=\r\nns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=\r\ng lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=\r\ntless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=\r\ng a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=\r\n deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=\r\nifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=\r\ns smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=\r\n visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=\r\nster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=\r\nk her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =\r\nEnron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=\r\nlity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=\r\nvatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=\r\nst water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=\r\ner sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20\r\nBut Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =\r\nbusiness fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=\r\nke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=\r\n it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=\r\nd confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =\r\nout at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=\r\n diminished, was folded into Enron. \"I think it's best for Rebecca to start=\r\n afresh,\" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=\r\n Or as one critic put it, \"They were more interested in destroying the old =\r\nculture than running a business.\"=20\r\nAs 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=\r\n announced the inevitable: \"The best time for the succession to occur is wh=\r\nen the company is doing well,\" he told the press. \"Enron is doing extremely=\r\n well now.\" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.\r\nALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=\r\npower market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=\r\nle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=\r\nhe company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=\r\nay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=\r\ne W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=\r\nod or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =\r\nanthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=\r\n the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=\r\nornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=\r\nried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=\r\neregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=\r\n was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=\r\naknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=\r\n January.\r\nWithin Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =\r\nIndia plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =\r\nconstant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=\r\ntion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=\r\nat the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =\r\nand never properly managed those it had. \"For three months Gray Davis did a=\r\n very good job of blaming us,\" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=\r\nrate communications. \"We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=\r\nte House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=\r\ngest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=\r\nare of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.\" (Californi=\r\na utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=\r\n be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=\r\nl too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=\r\nke comparing California with the Titanic. (\"At least the Titanic went down =\r\nwith its lights on.\")\r\nBut the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =\r\nbeen responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=\r\n believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=\r\n it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=\r\n buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=\r\non in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=\r\nid the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=\r\ne in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=\r\nrket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=\r\n Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.\r\nSkilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=\r\nhe stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=\r\nuring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=\r\nlenged Enron's financial reporting an \"asshole.\" When the company reported =\r\nhefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=\r\ns had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=\r\nts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=\r\nomised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. \"Th=\r\nere wasn't any positive news,\" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=\r\now. \"Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.\"\r\nThe business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=\r\nd in March whether Enron was overpriced. (\"Start with a pretty straightforw=\r\nard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?\") The routine cashing =\r\nin of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=\r\ned in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=\r\nay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=\r\nnal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=\r\nin the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=\r\ne failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=\r\ne stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=\r\nnally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. \"When Wall Stre=\r\net is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=\r\n\" says Carol Coale. \"When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=\r\nrry more weight.\"\r\nThis fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=\r\nxperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =\r\nthe most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=\r\nretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=\r\neir ways. \"It just created an attitude,\" one executive still at Enron says.=\r\n \"If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=\r\nere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'\"=20\r\nLoyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=\r\n now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=\r\np duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. \"But,\" as=\r\n one Houston oilman explains, \"if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=\r\nh someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=\r\non that's better suited for good times than bad.\"\r\nAs it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=\r\nck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=\r\n and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=\r\nes killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=\r\nm, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =\r\na new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=\r\n, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =\r\neverything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but \"innovat=\r\ne much closer to our core.\" As for the culture: \"Things like the Performanc=\r\ne Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=\r\ngorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=\r\nrale problem.\"\r\nThat Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=\r\n of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=\r\n their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=\r\nth Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=\r\nved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=\r\nen the company was in trouble, it was different. \"Even Jeff's biggest detra=\r\nctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,\" one loyalist admits.\r\nBut on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. \"Look,\" he s=\r\nays with finality, \"ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=\r\nerests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.\"\r\nFree of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=\r\nelf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=\r\nnologies. \"The first wave never gets it right,\" he says. \"The stand-alone d=\r\not-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=\r\nd wave that will change the world.\" Houston, he promises, will become the w=\r\norld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=\r\nact, he is already shopping for office space.\r\n\"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,\" he says, almost breathless. =\r\n\"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=\r\net it.\"\r\n","content":"\n=09You may have already read this but thought I'd forward on just in case. =\r\n MW\r\n\r\n -----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: =09Vignaroli, Donald =20\r\nSent:=09Thursday, October 25, 2001 9:15 AM\r\nTo:=09Bowers, Janet; Brennan, Lorna; Darveaux, Mary; Fritch, Bret; Graham, =\r\nCharlie; Joyce, Jane; Kirk, Steve; Sebesta, Chris; Swett, Larry; Thurber, B=\r\nob; Winckowski, Michele\r\nSubject:=09\r\n\r\nHow Enron Blew It\r\nLess than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=\r\ney, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=\r\nst important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=\r\narish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?\r\nby Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>\r\nTHE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=\r\ne international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=\r\n way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=\r\nompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=\r\nernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=\r\nrown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=\r\nhey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=\r\norm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=\r\nblic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=\r\ng intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=\r\nsize TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=\r\ntors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=\r\nople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=\r\npped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=\r\ns; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=\r\ninated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=\r\nting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=\r\nlevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: \"From the World's =\r\nLeading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!\"\r\nFor a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=\r\nm a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=\r\n. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=\r\ncent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=\r\nlion to $100 billion. \"The very mention of the company in energy circles th=\r\nroughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,\"=\r\n notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=\r\nrket intelligence to the energy business.\r\nThis Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=\r\nd to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=\r\ny then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =\r\nformula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =\r\nselling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=\r\nmpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=\r\n to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=\r\nnron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=\r\nation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=\r\nou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =\r\npower needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =\r\nnew and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=\r\nck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=\r\nhe company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=\r\nrld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=\r\neded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, \"was a great mar=\r\nriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=\r\nntality of the financial markets.\"\r\nThe Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=\r\nd of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=\r\n was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=\r\nan economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =\r\nculture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=\r\nhe best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=\r\no could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=\r\n the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=\r\n company couldn't possibly go wrong.\r\nOr could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =\r\n$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=\r\nrgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=\r\n his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=\r\nject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=\r\n, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=\r\nnce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=\r\nnge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=\r\ntain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=\r\nt the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.\r\nENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD \"a totally different way of thinking about b=\r\nusiness-we got it.\" At Enron, in fact, you either \"got it\" or you were gone=\r\n-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=\r\ne color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =\r\nonce headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=\r\nny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=\r\n off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=\r\nlack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=\r\nble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=\r\nling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=\r\nt six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=\r\nral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=\r\nrica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=\r\nhained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, \"someone cou=\r\nld actually get killed.\" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=\r\nistmas morning. \"I had no idea what I'd let go of,\" Skilling says of all th=\r\ne personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20\r\nFrom a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=\r\n photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=\r\nf working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=\r\ned, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=\r\ner. He almost missed his brother's wedding. \"Learning a foreign language-I =\r\nnever learned a foreign language!\" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=\r\ngest son to school. \"I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=\r\nen-minute scheduling.\" Travel: \"You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=\r\nnything out of it!\" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =\r\non his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. \"I'm not sure=\r\n that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,\" he says, finally=\r\n. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=\r\ns pragmatic edge. \"It would have been easy to stay,\" he says. \"But that wou=\r\nld not have been good for me.\"=20\r\nHe's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=\r\nsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=\r\nduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=\r\n underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=\r\neporters who have labeled his resignation \"bizarre\" and associates who are =\r\nbitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=\r\nits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=\r\n upon. \"I'm surprised,\" he says, \"that people have so much trouble understa=\r\nnding this.\"\r\nPEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=\r\nneties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=\r\nlding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=\r\no five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=\r\nine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=\r\nked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=\r\n hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=\r\nse days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=\r\nat scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =\r\nin Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=\r\n the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=\r\nuch humiliation?\r\nBut this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=\r\nes when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=\r\nas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=\r\nntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=\r\nolatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=\r\nral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=\r\ny gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=\r\n from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=\r\ns then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=\r\no chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=\r\ntoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=\r\nietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=\r\ndly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=\r\nNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=\r\ne of Texas.\r\nHNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=\r\nmpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =\r\npipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=\r\nn the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=\r\n in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =\r\nCoastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled \"the purchase\" was being call=\r\ned \"the merger\" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=\r\nly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=\r\navity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=\r\nnning a new company called Enron. \"Over time it became clear that Lay had a=\r\n better vision of the future,\" says one person associated with Enron at tha=\r\nt time. \"He never fought change. He embraced change.\"\r\nLay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=\r\n debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =\r\nexclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =\r\nnew business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=\r\ntarted.=20\r\nLIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=\r\nd spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=\r\nad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=\r\nllinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) \"I l=\r\niked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,\" he told Busines=\r\nsWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =\r\nwasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =\r\nwas anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=\r\nhat he would come to call \"intellectual capital.\" He loved being smart, and=\r\n he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=\r\nodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=\r\nk on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=\r\ns class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=\r\nup path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =\r\na business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20\r\nIt is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=\r\n, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=\r\n all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=\r\nying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=\r\none saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=\r\nhere credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=\r\n called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=\r\ne price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =\r\na broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =\r\nrisk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=\r\nestment bank would.\r\nSkilling worked up some numbers and found them \"absolutely compelling.\" The=\r\nn the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=\r\nutives. He had a one-page presentation. \"Almost to a person,\" Skilling says=\r\n, \"they thought it was stupid.\" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=\r\nected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=\r\nen said, \"Let's go.\"\r\nThe Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=\r\n cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=\r\nns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=\r\nse divides that seem to define his life: \"I believed this whole world would=\r\n be different, a huge breakthrough\" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =\r\neven if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=\r\n, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =\r\ncharacter, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=\r\n joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, \"We were in=\r\n.\" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=\r\non as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=\r\nr him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=\r\n. After that, says Skilling, \"we never looked back.\"\r\nSkilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=\r\nd a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=\r\nould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =\r\ngas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=\r\nate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=\r\nest access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =\r\nto be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=\r\netter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=\r\nake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=\r\nrice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=\r\nth startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =\r\nhave ever imagined.\r\nTHIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=\r\nade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=\r\ness. The idea was to build a \"knowledge-based business,\" which demanded a s=\r\nkill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=\r\nt were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=\r\nf them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=\r\n industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=\r\nolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =\r\nmoney-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. \"Enron was going to=\r\n create a niche for itself or die,\" one former executive explains. \"The peo=\r\nple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=\r\nrrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.\"\r\nSkilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=\r\nmartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=\r\ncause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =\r\nwanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=\r\ngest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=\r\noston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be \"a=\r\nggressive.\" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=\r\nere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20\r\nYou could see what he was looking for on \"Super Saturdays\" at the Houston h=\r\neadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=\r\nn-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=\r\n day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=\r\nbility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called \"a sense =\r\nof urgency.\" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =\r\ncandidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=\r\nhe types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =\r\nEnron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=\r\nybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =\r\nthan enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=\r\nts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=\r\ng suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)\r\nFor the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=\r\nnd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=\r\nturing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=\r\nlobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=\r\npany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=\r\n with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=\r\ne house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=\r\non never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=\r\nld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=\r\nerweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=\r\nm. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=\r\nen at night. \"They were so cutting edge,\" rhapsodizes someone involved with=\r\n the company health care program at the time. \"They really thought about th=\r\ne psychology and what it took to keep these people going.\"\r\nSkilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=\r\n, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=\r\ne titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=\r\nnd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=\r\nes-with no cap. \"If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=\r\n make a lot of money,\" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=\r\ntil resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=\r\nision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =\r\nwith two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=\r\n. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=\r\ned him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=\r\nf-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=\r\nectacular Mexican villa. \"Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=\r\nd say,\" one loyalist says.=20\r\nAnd why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=\r\nerchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=\r\nuzzword was \"aggressive,\" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=\r\nved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=\r\n Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=\r\nice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=\r\nn barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=\r\nny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=\r\nrvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=\r\ne somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=\r\nrts).\r\nBut the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=\r\nade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =\r\nthe division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=\r\ngest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=\r\nn had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=\r\n2 billion to $7 billion. \"Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=\r\n in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,\" the New =\r\nYork Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=\r\ning had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=\r\nsforming another.\r\n\"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,\"=\r\n sang the New York Times in 1999. \"In the staid world of regulated utilitie=\r\ns and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,\" crowed For=\r\ntune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=\r\ne, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=\r\n, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=\r\ncover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=\r\nel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=\r\n client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=\r\ne against the usual winter downturn?\r\nBut most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=\r\nommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=\r\ncame another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=\r\nnline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=\r\nd price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=\r\non, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=\r\ny lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=\r\nng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=\r\nt the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=\r\n deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=\r\n in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. \"Its strat=\r\negy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=\r\ndities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,\" BusinessWeek insis=\r\nted.\r\nThere was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =\r\nthe company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=\r\nustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=\r\nomers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=\r\no come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=\r\nents as customers and began calling them \"counterparties.\"\r\nSkilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=\r\naximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=\r\n overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=\r\ne quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=\r\nl-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=\r\nderwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=\r\nets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=\r\n, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=\r\nd at all.=20\r\nWhile many businesses used what was known in the industry as \"mark-to-marke=\r\nt accounting,\" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=\r\nompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=\r\n idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=\r\nt deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=\r\nnuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=\r\never many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=\r\n went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=\r\nht be something fishy about what they called \"subjective accounting,\" inves=\r\ntors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=\r\net fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=\r\nt that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =\r\ngoing to be high enough. \"Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,\" =\r\nsays one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=\r\nany could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=\r\n for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=\r\nontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=\r\nting literacy charity: \"Even the person who was supposed to give money away=\r\n for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,\" he says.\r\nAs Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =\r\ntook on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=\r\nron family put it, \"It became a company full of mercenaries.\" The change st=\r\narted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =\r\nof the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=\r\nhe commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=\r\nrhearing orders like \"I need a smart person-go buy me one\" or \"Buy me an in=\r\ntelligent slave, quick.\" Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=\r\ne sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=\r\nrody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=\r\no disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.\r\nAnd, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=\r\n. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=\r\nkilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=\r\nystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=\r\nhose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=\r\nickly became \"rank and yank.\") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=\r\nsion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=\r\niate put it, \"Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=\r\n store.\" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=\r\nn's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=\r\nitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=\r\ne, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=\r\non higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=\r\n he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=\r\nore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.\r\nEveryone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =\r\n\"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=\r\night of the future,\" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=\r\nals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=\r\nps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=\r\nn as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase \"No old tapes\" became a=\r\nn Enron clich?. \"People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,\" says=\r\n one former Enron executive.\r\nIn such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=\r\nictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=\r\n E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=\r\ne for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =\r\nbut they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=\r\ns way: \"They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=\r\nou bleed to death.\"\r\nBEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =\r\ncompany into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=\r\nust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=\r\nts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=\r\nlt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=\r\nealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=\r\non's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=\r\nojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=\r\nous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. \"It wasn't the tim=\r\ne for long-term approaches,\" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=\r\n \"It was the technology era.\"\r\nTo rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=\r\ncca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=\r\nars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=\r\nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=\r\ne requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=\r\nron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =\r\n$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=\r\nf Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=\r\ne Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =\r\ntwo appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=\r\nrate America.\r\nBut then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=\r\na, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=\r\nay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=\r\nercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=\r\nhanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=\r\ner Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=\r\n, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.\r\nForcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=\r\nns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=\r\ng lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=\r\ntless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=\r\ng a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=\r\n deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=\r\nifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=\r\ns smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=\r\n visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=\r\nster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=\r\nk her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =\r\nEnron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=\r\nlity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=\r\nvatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=\r\nst water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=\r\ner sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20\r\nBut Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =\r\nbusiness fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=\r\nke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=\r\n it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=\r\nd confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =\r\nout at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=\r\n diminished, was folded into Enron. \"I think it's best for Rebecca to start=\r\n afresh,\" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=\r\n Or as one critic put it, \"They were more interested in destroying the old =\r\nculture than running a business.\"=20\r\nAs 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=\r\n announced the inevitable: \"The best time for the succession to occur is wh=\r\nen the company is doing well,\" he told the press. \"Enron is doing extremely=\r\n well now.\" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.\r\nALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=\r\npower market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=\r\nle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=\r\nhe company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=\r\nay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=\r\ne W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=\r\nod or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =\r\nanthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=\r\n the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=\r\nornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=\r\nried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=\r\neregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=\r\n was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=\r\naknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=\r\n January.\r\nWithin Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =\r\nIndia plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =\r\nconstant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=\r\ntion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=\r\nat the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =\r\nand never properly managed those it had. \"For three months Gray Davis did a=\r\n very good job of blaming us,\" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=\r\nrate communications. \"We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=\r\nte House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=\r\ngest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=\r\nare of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.\" (Californi=\r\na utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=\r\n be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=\r\nl too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=\r\nke comparing California with the Titanic. (\"At least the Titanic went down =\r\nwith its lights on.\")\r\nBut the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =\r\nbeen responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=\r\n believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=\r\n it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=\r\n buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=\r\non in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=\r\nid the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=\r\ne in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=\r\nrket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=\r\n Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.\r\nSkilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=\r\nhe stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=\r\nuring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=\r\nlenged Enron's financial reporting an \"asshole.\" When the company reported =\r\nhefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=\r\ns had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=\r\nts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=\r\nomised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. \"Th=\r\nere wasn't any positive news,\" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=\r\now. \"Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.\"\r\nThe business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=\r\nd in March whether Enron was overpriced. (\"Start with a pretty straightforw=\r\nard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?\") The routine cashing =\r\nin of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=\r\ned in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=\r\nay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=\r\nnal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=\r\nin the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=\r\ne failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=\r\ne stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=\r\nnally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. \"When Wall Stre=\r\net is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=\r\n\" says Carol Coale. \"When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=\r\nrry more weight.\"\r\nThis fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=\r\nxperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =\r\nthe most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=\r\nretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=\r\neir ways. \"It just created an attitude,\" one executive still at Enron says.=\r\n \"If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=\r\nere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'\"=20\r\nLoyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=\r\n now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=\r\np duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. \"But,\" as=\r\n one Houston oilman explains, \"if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=\r\nh someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=\r\non that's better suited for good times than bad.\"\r\nAs it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=\r\nck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=\r\n and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=\r\nes killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=\r\nm, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =\r\na new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=\r\n, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =\r\neverything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but \"innovat=\r\ne much closer to our core.\" As for the culture: \"Things like the Performanc=\r\ne Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=\r\ngorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=\r\nrale problem.\"\r\nThat Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=\r\n of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=\r\n their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=\r\nth Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=\r\nved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=\r\nen the company was in trouble, it was different. \"Even Jeff's biggest detra=\r\nctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,\" one loyalist admits.\r\nBut on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. \"Look,\" he s=\r\nays with finality, \"ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=\r\nerests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.\"\r\nFree of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=\r\nelf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=\r\nnologies. \"The first wave never gets it right,\" he says. \"The stand-alone d=\r\not-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=\r\nd wave that will change the world.\" Houston, he promises, will become the w=\r\norld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=\r\nact, he is already shopping for office space.\r\n\"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,\" he says, almost breathless. =\r\n\"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=\r\net it.\"\r\n","messageId":"<15006545.1075858662569.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-10-25T20:46:12+05:30","from":"michele.winckowski@enron.com","subject":"FW: Article on Enron","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968","contentTransferEncoding":"quoted-printable","xFrom":"Winckowski, Michele </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MWINCKO>","xFolder":"\\RRING (Non-Privileged)\\Inbox","xOrigin":"Ring-R","xFileName":"RRING (Non-Privileged)1.pst"}

{"rawContent":"\nRichard -\r\n\r\nExcellent summary.  thanks.\r\nRH\r\n\r\n -----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: =09Ring, Richard =20\r\nSent:=09Wednesday, October 24, 2001 7:08 PM\r\nTo:=09Herndon, Rogers\r\nSubject:=09\r\n\r\nRogers,\r\n\r\nEnron Energy Services, Inc. (\"EESI\") submitted application to become a NEPO=\r\nOL member, to be effective January 1, 2000.  EESI was approved by the NEPOO=\r\nL Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January 24, 2000 meeting.  On=\r\ne requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po=\r\nlicy for NEPOOL Members.  EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Powe=\r\nr Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the =\r\nFinancial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than =\r\ncorporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate =\r\nGuaranty required by NEPOOL.\r\n\r\nEESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in th=\r\ne amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in J=\r\nune 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New =\r\nEngland dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements)=\r\n and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's cu=\r\nrrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th=\r\ne amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  Becky d=\r\nelivered the October 10th letter  to my attention whereby I took the letter=\r\n to EESI Legal Department (Karen Cordova) and informed Karen that EESI need=\r\ned to increase the Performance Bond to $20,000,000.  Karen requested Credit=\r\n Department (Nichole Gunter) initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t=\r\no the $20,000,000 level; to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati=\r\non with Credit Department was October 12, 2001.  In telephone conversations=\r\n with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE t=\r\nhat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r=\r\nesolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (Oc=\r\ntober 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such.=20\r\n\r\nI was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond compa=\r\nny Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance=\r\n Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin=\r\ng invoices for \"other\" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $1=\r\n50,000.  The \"other\" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI=\r\n, since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, J=\r\neff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.  Payments for the \"=\r\nother\" performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque=\r\nst for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, which w=\r\nas issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on Octo=\r\nber 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October =\r\n23, 2001.  EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to =\r\nresolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond =\r\ncompany as mentioned above.  Credit Department personnel informed ISO-NE pe=\r\nrsonnel that EESI would not meet the October 19, 2001 deadline, but was wor=\r\nking diligently to resolve the matter; Credit Department personnel sent via=\r\n FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor=\r\nmance Bond to ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001. =20\r\n\r\nI notified Dan Allegretti, (Enron Government Affairs & Chariman, NEPOOL Par=\r\nticipants Committee) of the entire situation prior to October 19, 2001.  Da=\r\nn indicated that he did not think there would be any problems, but to get t=\r\nhe matter resolved as quickly as possible. Dan advised me that the implicat=\r\nions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t=\r\nhe Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published, the=\r\n following month, EESI would no longer be listed as being in default.  On O=\r\nctober 19, 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) f=\r\nrom Edward McKenna, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer informing EESI=\r\n that \"Enron Energy Services, Inc. has not maintained the required level of=\r\n financial assurance for 10 days or more, and has had a total combination o=\r\nf 3 financial assurance and/or payment defaults in the last 12 months, whic=\r\nh qualifies them as having 2 (two) Level 1 defaults.  The ISO has been in c=\r\nontact with Enron Energy Services, Inc. through multiple telephone communic=\r\nations, and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured.

(\"EESI\") submitted application to become a NEPO=\r\nOL member, to be effective January 1, 2000.  EESI was approved by the NEPOO=\r\nL Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January 24, 2000 meeting.  On=\r\ne requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po=\r\nlicy for NEPOOL Members.  EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Powe=\r\nr Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the =\r\nFinancial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than =\r\ncorporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate =\r\nGuaranty required by NEPOOL.\r\n\r\nEESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in th=\r\ne amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in J=\r\nune 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New =\r\nEngland dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements)=\r\n and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's cu=\r\nrrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th=\r\ne amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  Becky d=\r\nelivered the October 10th letter  to my attention whereby I took the letter=\r\n to EESI Legal Department (Karen Cordova) and informed Karen that EESI need=\r\ned to increase the Performance Bond to $20,000,000.  Karen requested Credit=\r\n Department (Nichole Gunter) initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t=\r\no the $20,000,000 level; to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati=\r\non with Credit Department was October 12, 2001.  In telephone conversations=\r\n with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE t=\r\nhat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r=\r\nesolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (Oc=\r\ntober 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such.=20\r\n\r\nI was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond compa=\r\nny Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance=\r\n Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin=\r\ng invoices for \"other\" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $1=\r\n50,000.  The \"other\" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI=\r\n, since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, J=\r\neff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.  Payments for the \"=\r\nother\" performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque=\r\nst for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, which w=\r\nas issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on Octo=\r\nber 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October =\r\n23, 2001.  EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to =\r\nresolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond =\r\ncompany as mentioned above.  Credit Department personnel informed ISO-NE pe=\r\nrsonnel that EESI would not meet the October 19, 2001 deadline, but was wor=\r\nking diligently to resolve the matter; Credit Department personnel sent via=\r\n FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor=\r\nmance Bond to ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001. =20\r\n\r\nI notified Dan Allegretti, (Enron Government Affairs & Chariman, NEPOOL Par=\r\nticipants Committee) of the entire situation prior to October 19, 2001.  Da=\r\nn indicated that he did not think there would be any problems, but to get t=\r\nhe matter resolved as quickly as possible. Dan advised me that the implicat=\r\nions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t=\r\nhe Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published, the=\r\n following month, EESI would no longer be listed as being in default.  On O=\r\nctober 19, 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) f=\r\nrom Edward McKenna, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer informing EESI=\r\n that \"Enron Energy Services, Inc. has not maintained the required level of=\r\n financial assurance for 10 days or more, and has had a total combination o=\r\nf 3 financial assurance and/or payment defaults in the last 12 months, whic=\r\nh qualifies them as having 2 (two) Level 1 defaults.  The ISO has been in c=\r\nontact with Enron Energy Services, Inc. through multiple telephone communic=\r\nations, and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured.  Th=\r\nerefore, per the established procedure, we are forwarding this information =\r\nto the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them.\"  According to Da=\r\nn Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him, as Chariman of the=\r\n Members Subcommittee, and he would discuss the issue with them.

{"rawContent":"\nToday FERC issued the following draft orders:\n\nNYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.  \n\nNYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.\n\nNYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made \"but for\" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  \n\nISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.\n\nCalpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.\n\n\nIf you need further information, please let me know.\n\nSusan Lindberg\nx30596","content":"\nToday FERC issued the following draft orders:\n\nNYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.

{"rawContent":"\n\nToday, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.\n\nWe made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.\n\nOver the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.\n\nFollowing are the highlights of our businesses:\n\nWholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).\nAmericas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).\nEurope and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.\n\nRetail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.\n\n\nTransportation and Distribution:\n\tNatural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.\nPortland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.\nGlobal Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.\n\nBroadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.\n\nCorporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.\n\nIn addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:\n?\tA $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.\n?\t$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.\n?\t$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  \n\nWith our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

{"rawContent":"\nIn our continuing effort to provide security and stability to the revenue-producing systems here at EES, we would like to ask for your assistance with a few items.  In general, we want to ensure that all business critical systems are clear from the risk of downtime, which could negatively impact the business.\n\nSo, what does this mean to you?  We need to make sure that any computer programs and files you use to do your job are protected and reside in an environment that is controlled by the IT infrastructure group.  This serves several purposes, including:\n\nEnsuring that everything business critical is backed up properly and can be recovered if a workstation's hard drive fails.\nEnsuring that specialized programs like Cobra or BSOC or RPS or RGS which are business critical can easily be installed on any workstation by the IT group.  This will help keep the business up and running if you have to switch workstations suddenly.\n\nSpecialized applications - If you use any special program to do your work, such as WinAT or some other database, analysis, or special utility tool, the IT infrastructure group should be made aware of it so that they can learn how to install and maintain it.  This way, if an elephant sneaks into the office one night and steps on your computer, we can build out another workstation, install the specialized programs on it for you, and deliver it to you so that you can continue to do your job.  Please contact Christine Nguyen at (713) 345-8459 if you think your computer application is not currently maintained by IT.\n\nFiles: Spreadsheets, Excel macros, MS Access databases, and the like - Please make sure that any spreadsheets or MS Access databases you use for the business are not stored on your local computer drives.  These files should be stored on a network-shared drive (in general, something other than C or D drive).  That way, if that elephant comes back another night, we could get you another workstation from which to operate without losing any of your valuable work.\n\nWeb sites - If you are responsible for maintaining a web site that is business critical, including those used by inside as well as outside customers, we need to make sure that this web site is hosted on one of the fault-tolerant redundant web servers provided by IT infrastructure, and not running on a laptop tucked away under your desk.  This will help keep the web site available to those who need it in the event of power outages, server failures, and other unforeseen hardware-related problems.  Please contact Larry Hack at (713) 345-5783 if you think your web site is not currently maintained by IT.\n\nYour support with this effort is greatly appreciated.","content":"\nIn our continuing effort to provide security and stability to the revenue-producing systems here at EES, we would like to ask for your assistance with a few items.

This will help keep the business up and running if you have to switch workstations suddenly.\n\nSpecialized applications - If you use any special program to do your work, such as WinAT or some other database, analysis, or special utility tool, the IT infrastructure group should be made aware of it so that they can learn how to install and maintain it.  This way, if an elephant sneaks into the office one night and steps on your computer, we can build out another workstation, install the specialized programs on it for you, and deliver it to you so that you can continue to do your job.  Please contact Christine Nguyen at (713) 345-8459 if you think your computer application is not currently maintained by IT.\n\nFiles: Spreadsheets, Excel macros, MS Access databases, and the like - Please make sure that any spreadsheets or MS Access databases you use for the business are not stored on your local computer drives.  These files should be stored on a network-shared drive (in general, something other than C or D drive).  That way, if that elephant comes back another night, we could get you another workstation from which to operate without losing any of your valuable work.\n\nWeb sites - If you are responsible for maintaining a web site that is business critical, including those used by inside as well as outside customers, we need to make sure that this web site is hosted on one of the fault-tolerant redundant web servers provided by IT infrastructure, and not running on a laptop tucked away under your desk.  This will help keep the web site available to those who need it in the event of power outages, server failures, and other unforeseen hardware-related problems.  Please contact Larry Hack at (713) 345-5783 if you think your web site is not currently maintained by IT.\n\nYour support with this effort is greatly appreciated.","messageId":"<26058838.1075858664750.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-10-05T04:08:27+05:30","from":"anthony.dayao@enron.com","subject":"IT Update: Security/Stability of Revenue-Producing Systems","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Dayao, Anthony </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=F413C83A-4BDDD069-86256A40-55A8EB>","xTo":"EES Employees@ENRON","xFolder":"\\RRING (Non-Privileged)\\PersonalFolder","xOrigin":"Ring-R","xFileName":"RRING (Non-Privileged)1.pst"}

{"rawContent":"\nRecently, I asked you to \"Lay It On the Line\" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the survey results.\n\nIn just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.\n\nI.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.

Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.\n\n1.\tPeople (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):\n---\ttalented\n---\tcreative\n---     learn from one another\n2.\tCulture and reputation:\n---\tinnovative spirit\n---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks\n---   ability to embrace change\n---   involvement in community\n3.\tWork environment:\n---\tpay and benefits\n---   true meritocracy\n---   unlimited opportunities\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.\n\nNow, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.\n\nSTOCK PRICE\n\nWe are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:\n---\tA decline in the overall market and economy;\n---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;\n---   A \"meltdown\" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;\n---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and\n---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.\n\nThese concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.\n\n---\tOver the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.\n---\tWe have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.\nWe also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:\n---\tMark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.\n--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.\n\nTHE PRC\n\nThe relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.\n\nTherefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:\n---\tEffective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.\n---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.\n---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.\n---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.\n\nIn the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.\n\nEMPLOYEE MORALE\n\nWe believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.\n---\tWe are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.\nOver the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.\n---\tWe will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.\n---\tAdditionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.\n\nEXTERNAL REPUTATION\n\nWe all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:\n---\tWe will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.\n--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.\n\nINTEGRITY & RESPECT\n\nI believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.\n---\tEnron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.\n---\tWe will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.\n---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.\n\nFinally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.","content":"\nRecently, I asked you to \"Lay It On the Line\" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.

To ensure you are better informed:\n---\tWe will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.\n--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.\n\nINTEGRITY & RESPECT\n\nI believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.\n---\tEnron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.\n---\tWe will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.\n---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.\n\nFinally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.","messageId":"<1727886.1075858664845.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-10-03T02:54:19+05:30","from":"40enron@enron.com","subject":"Lay It On the Line Survey Results","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Ken Lay- Chairman of the Board@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-Ken+20Lay-+20Chairman+20of+20the+20Board+40ENRON@ENRON.com>","xTo":"All Enron Worldwide@ENRON","xFolder":"\\RRING (Non-Privileged)\\PersonalFolder","xOrigin":"Ring-R","xFileName":"RRING (Non-Privileged)1.pst"}

A warm thanks to all who touched us with their\nresponses. Sympathies arrived from Germany, Italy, France,\nPoland, Pakistan, India, Israel, Malaysia, the Philippines,\nAustralia, Canada, Columbia, and Cuba. It's a good reminder\nthat the people of the United States do not stand alone.\n\nToday's \"Energy Fact and Tip\" focuses on the energy\nimpacts of last week's attack, but the remainder of our\nnewsletter returns to its standard format.\n\nAlso, today's newsletter was delayed due to concerns about\nthe \"Nimda\" computer worm. We apologize for any\ninconvenience.\n\n\nCalifornia Power Authority Pursues 1000 MW of Renewables\n\nThe new California Power and Conservation Financing\nAuthority, which has the mission of ensuring a reliable power\nsupply for the state, has announced its intentions to acquire\n1000 megawatts (MW) of new renewable energy capacity by\nnext summer. The Power Authority is currently negotiating\nwith 14 parties, representing mainly wind and biomass projects,\nto supply the needed capacity. See the September 17th\npress release on the Power Authority's Web site at:\n<http://www.capowerauthority.ca.gov/MediaRelease/main.asp>.\n\nThe Power Authority is also requesting bids for fuel cells\nsystems, microturbines, and solar photovoltaic systems.\nSee: <http://www.capowerauthority.ca.gov/Requestforbids/main.asp>.\n\nGovernor Gray Davis has set a goal of providing 17 percent\nof the state's electricity supply from renewable energy\nsources, which the authority estimates will require 3,000 MW\nof new renewable energy capacity over the next five years.\nSee the Background section of the Power Authority Web site\nat: <http://www.capowerauthority.ca.gov/background/main.asp>.\n\n\nNew Hybrid System to Power Honda Civic in 2002\n\nA hybrid electric version of the Honda Civic will be available\nin the United States in 2002, and it will use a new, improved\nhybrid gasoline-electric system as its power source. The new\nsystem combines Honda Motor Company's newest lean-burn\n4-cylinder engine with a more powerful motor, a more\nefficient battery, and a smaller power control unit than are\nused in the Honda Insight. The system also shuts down\nthree of the four cylinders when decelerating, cutting the\nengine's compressive braking in half and allowing more\nenergy to be captured via regenerative braking, which\ncharges the battery. The result of all these features is a gas\nmileage of about 68 miles per gallon, according to Honda.\nThe company expects to mass produce the new Hybrid\nCivic, which will seat five. Although the vehicle will be\navailable in Japan in fall of this year, it won't be sold in the\nUnited States until spring 2002. See the Honda press\nrelease at:\n<http://world.honda.com/news/2001/4010904.html>.\n\nHonda also debuted its latest fuel-cell-powered car, the\nFCX-V4, early this month. This latest experimental model\nhas a top speed of 87 miles per hour and, thanks to a high-\npressure hydrogen storage tank, can travel 186 miles\nbetween fill-ups. Honda worked to make this model more of\na \"real\" vehicle by including luggage space and safety\nfeatures and even designing a user-friendly display for\nmonitoring the fuel cell and energy storage system. The\ncompany still maintains that its goal is to introduce a\nproduction fuel cell vehicle in 2003. See the Honda press\nrelease at:\n<http://world.honda.com/news/2001/c010904_1.html>.\n\n\nHome Depot Starts Selling Residential Solar Power Systems\n\nSome energy experts have said that the solar energy\nindustry won't be truly successful until the average consumer\ncan walk into The Home Depot and buy a solar power\nsystem. Well, that day has arrived -- in San Diego,\nCalifornia, at least. AstroPower, Inc. announced in early\nSeptember that three of The Home Depot's stores in the\nSan Diego area are now offering the systems. The Home\nDepot is providing a full-service program that includes\nfinancing, installation, and service of the solar power\nsystems. See the AstroPower press release at:\n<http://www.astropower.com/homedepot_release.htm>.\n\nCombined with last month's announcement about residential\nsolar energy systems from Green Mountain Energy Company\n(GMEC), the AstroPower announcement suggests that solar\nenergy may finally be achieving mainstream acceptance in\nthe United States. See the GMEC announcement in the\nSeptember 5th issue of EREN Network News at:\n<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2001/sept05_01.html>.\n\nNeed to know more about the status of solar electric power?\nUPEx'01, the Photovoltaic Experience Conference and\nExhibition, is coming to Sacramento, California, with\nsponsorship by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and\nthe Solar Electric Power Association (SEPA). The\nconference will be held as originally scheduled, from\nSeptember 30 through October 4. For more information, see\nthe SEPA Web site at:\n<http://www.solarelectricpower.org/upex/default.cfm>.\n\n\nOrganic Molecules May Yield Inexpensive Solar Cells\n\nProducing solar cells may one day be as simple as applying\na liquid to a sheet of plastic and waiting for the cells to\n\"assemble\" themselves, according to researchers at the\nUniversity of Arizona. The liquid will be composed of organic\nmolecules that will collect on the plastic surface in a way that\nforms a very organized coating. If the researchers are\nsuccessful, that coating will be able to efficiently convert\nsolar energy into electricity. If the difficult task of creating the\nright organic molecules succeeds, the simplicity of the\nproduction process could result in low-cost solar cells. The\nresearch is partially funded by DOE's National Renewable\nEnergy Laboratory. See the story by selecting \"Science &\nResearch\" in the header of the university's news page at:\n<http://uanews.opi.arizona.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/UANews>.\n\n\nStateline Wind Project Gets Green Light in Oregon\n\nThe Stateline Wind Project, a 300-megawatt wind project\nthat straddles the border between Washington and Oregon,\nhas received approval for construction from the Oregon\nEnergy Facility Siting Council. Due to concerns about\nimpacts on the Washington ground squirrel, which is listed\nas an endangered species in Oregon, two strings of turbines\nhad to be eliminated from the Oregon side of the border.\nFPL Energy is already constructing the project on the\nWashington state side. See the council's announcement at:\n<http://www.energy.state.or.us/siting/announce.htm#Stateline>.\n\nFor more information about the Stateline Wind Project, see\nthe project Web site at: <http://www.statelinewind.com/>.\n\n\nDOE Awards $30 Million for Bioproduct Technologies\n\nDOE announced on Monday that it will award $30 million to\n11 projects that will develop technology to  produce\nchemicals, plastics, materials and other products from plant\nmatter and other natural waste materials. These so-called\n\"bioproducts\" save energy while reducing the use of\nnonrenewable resources such as petroleum. The 11 projects\nwill be carried out over the next three to five years, and\ncover the range of processes from harvesting to final\nproduct. Funds will also establish university education and\ntraining programs in the area of bioproducts.

To improve\nthe efficiency of these engines, DOE is investing $3.6 million\nin seven research and development projects. The projects\nwill also seek to lower costs and emissions from the engines.\nSee the DOE press release at:\n<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases01/seppr/pr01158.htm>.\n\nHonda Motor Company, Ltd. announced in late August that it\nis preparing to test a home unit in Japan that produces\npower, heat, and hot water using a natural-gas engine.\nSystems that produce both heat and electricity are called\n\"cogenerators.\" The Honda cogenerator will produce one\nkilowatt of electricity and three kilowatts of heat, converting\n85 percent of the energy in the natural gas into either heat or\nelectricity.

Two electrical substations next to the\nTrade Center were totally destroyed and a third substation\nwas knocked out of service. Major electrical transmission\ncables were also lost. As of this morning, the city's electric\nutility, Con Edison, had managed to restore power to all of\nlower Manhattan after installing more than 33 miles of new\nhigh-voltage cable. However, the utility is still asking people\nin lower Manhattan to minimize their use of electricity. More\nthan 1,900 Con Edison workers have labored around the\nclock to restore power. See the Con Edison press releases\nat: <http://www.coned.com/about/about.asp?subframe=news>.\n\nIn response to the attacks, security was heightened\nthroughout the U.S. energy infrastructure. Shipments of\nnuclear material were halted and security was heightened at\nnuclear plants, refineries, pipelines, and along the electricity\ntransmission grid. Taking a longer view, the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission (FERC) noted that the electric, gas,\nand oil companies that it regulates may need to adopt new\nprocedures, update existing procedures, and install facilities\nto further safeguard their systems. FERC announced that it\nwill approve applications to \"recover prudently incurred\ncosts\" for such actions and will expedite any such requests.\nThese costs will presumably be passed on to consumers.\nSee the FERC announcement at:\n<http://cips.ferc.fed.us/Q/CIPS/MISC/PL/PL01-6.000.TXT>.\n\nFears of supply disruptions apparently led some U.S. gas\nstations to hike their prices to as much as $5 per gallon.\nDOE Secretary Spencer Abraham announced on the day\nafter the attack that such price hikes were unjustified, and\nasked consumers to call the DOE Hotline (1-800-244-3301)\nto report such incidents. See the DOE press release at:\n<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases01/seppr/pr01155.htm>.\n\nAs of Monday, DOE's Energy Information Administration\n(EIA) reported that U.S. petroleum prices were generally\nholding steady.

{"rawContent":"\nThe articles below provide excellent commentary on what we are up against. =\r\n Whether we like it or not history is littered with fallen empires and nati=\r\nons who have persecuted the Jews.  Israel, unlike us, at least until now, u=\r\nnderstands that it is in a war; a war for it's very survival; a war against=\r\n those who openly state that they do not consider Israel to have the right =\r\nto even exist.  But we know from the Bible that Israel will always exist an=\r\nd those who help the Jews, God will bless and those who hate the Jews, God =\r\nwill punish.  And even though we don't always agree with what Israel does, =\r\nthey are our friends, they know how to fight, and they are our allies in th=\r\nis War.\r\n=20\r\nIsrael knows they are in a fight for their very existence.  The same enemy =\r\nof the Jews hates America.  They hate America and the West for the very rea=\r\nsons outlined in the article below.  They are and have been openly at war w=\r\nith us for years.  Every American better understand that now! And if we don=\r\n't have the best intelligence service and the best armed forces in the worl=\r\nd we are going to continue to pay dearly.  Several years before World War T=\r\nwo, MacArthur, while Chief of Staff of the Army, stated that there was noth=\r\ning more expensive than a cheap army.  We can expand that today to include =\r\nall aspects of national security to include an intelligence apparatus neces=\r\nsary to penetrate enemy organizations.  The additional challenge we face is=\r\n in curbing the never ending desire for bigger and stronger government at t=\r\nhe expense of freedom.  Can we as a people vote in statesmen rather than po=\r\nliticians to fill the ranks of government?\r\n=20\r\nBut above and beyond all of this is the fact that the Christian (those who =\r\nbelieve in Jesus Christ - \"faith alone in Christ alone\" - for salvation) mu=\r\nst understand that Jesus Christ does control history and no matter what hap=\r\npens on the historical scene He will take care of us both in life and in de=\r\nath.

Jews w=\r\nere originally treated decently for a while within Islam.  As was women, un=\r\ntil the Arabs encountered the tradition of purdah in India. Mohammed incorp=\r\norated the Jewish prophets and have Jesus as one of  his prophets.=20\r\n\r\nAs to comments that our relationship with Israel is the basis of this confl=\r\nict, I disagree.   There is a perceived cultural divide on the part of the =\r\nfanatical Muslims.  The West is more representative of the devil's evil way=\r\ns.  We are to them to the pagans that Christian missionaries sought to conv=\r\nert.  However, conversion to Islam is usually done under the sword.  And it=\r\n goes deeper.  We have defeated the Islamic forces when we have engaged the=\r\nm.  And the Israelis have also done so.  The defeats have been so thorough =\r\nas to be humiliating.    =20\r\n\r\nIsrael must perceive itself as being independent.  Politically their leader=\r\n never could accept direct orders from another state.  But, note, one of th=\r\ne first countries to offer sympathy and support was Israel.  =20\r\nNote one thing.  Arabs started the slave trade.  Swahili is the language of=\r\n the Arab slave traders with their African business partners.  African Musl=\r\nims were buried in a separate section in a Muslim cemetery.  Farrakan and h=\r\nis followers wake up.=20\r\n\r\nPakistan has declared it would support the US with permitting overhead flig=\r\nhts.  The Afghanis are flooding out of their country.  The Afghan leaders a=\r\nre announcing that they are safe, don't worry.  The bottom line is that eve=\r\nn the Afghanis under the Taliban know who will win.=20\r\nWe have won the first skirmish in the War Against Terrorists.=20\r\n\r\nM/Petit=20\r\n\r\n-ubject: Re: Article on the Cause of the Attack=20\r\n\r\nInteresting historical presentation - good food for thought - I also refer =\r\nyou to page A-28 of the 15 September 2001 Washington Post.=20\r\n\r\nBush requests Shaon get on with talks with Arafat - Sharon says shove it up=\r\n your nose - is this a positive thinking member of the western world?

Christian Lebanese Arabs actually did the killing; but th=\r\ne Israeli army was in the neighborhood, and was responsible, at some theore=\r\ntical level, for keeping the peace in the zone that included the camps. Bec=\r\nause of this, the Israelis took much of the brunt of the world's outrage at=\r\n the killings. Commenting on these events, the Israeli Prime Minister, Mena=\r\nchem Begin, remarked in disgust: \"Goyim kill goyim, and they blame the Jews=\r\n!\"=20\r\nI've been getting the same feeling from some of my e-mail. The fundamental =\r\nreason America is under attack by Arab terrorists, several dozen people wan=\r\nt me to know, is that the U.S. supports Israel. And the only reason we do t=\r\nhat, several of them have said, or hinted, is because of the political powe=\r\nr of the Jewish lobby here in the U.S.A. A few of my correspondents have ex=\r\npressed themselves more ... bluntly than that. Put it this way: While I hav=\r\ne not yet encountered the word \"bloodsuckers\" (perhaps my readership isn't =\r\n\"diverse\" enough), some of this stuff comes pretty close - though I should =\r\nsay in fairness, most is argued on cold national-interest grounds. At any r=\r\nate, a lot of people feel that the mass killing of Americans by Arab terror=\r\nists is all the fault of Israel and those American politicians who, for low=\r\n and disreputable motives, or from sheer blindness to America's true ideals=\r\n and interests, support her. Goyim kill goyim, and they blame the Jews.=20\r\nSetting aside the statistical certainty that some of the dead Americans are=\r\n Jewish (as, in high statistical probability, some were of Arab origins), a=\r\nnd at the risk of yet more ill-tempered or abusive e-mails, I am going to d=\r\neclare that I don't think these recent outrages can be blamed on the Jews, =\r\nnor even on pro-Israel American politicians. The root phenomenon is not Ame=\r\nrican involvement in Middle Eastern affairs: The root phenomenon is hespero=\r\nphobia.=20\r\nThis word was coined by the political scientist Robert Conquest. Its roots =\r\nare the Greek words hesperos, which means \"the west\" and phobos, which mean=\r\ns \"fear,\" but which when used as an English suffix can also carry the meani=\r\nng \"hate.\" Hesperophobia is fear or hatred of the West. [While I'm in the c=\r\nlassical stuff, by the way, I committed a breach of good manners in my last=\r\n posting by inserting a Latin tag without translation. I am sorry. Oderint =\r\ndum metuant means \"Let them hate us, so long as they fear us.\" Seneca rebuk=\r\ned Cicero for saying it, though it seems to have been current among educate=\r\nd late-republican Romans.]=20\r\nHere is the news: A lot of people out there hate us. The name \"Durban\" mean=\r\n anything? In China, in India, in Pakistan, in Indonesia and Malaysia, in A=\r\nfrica, and in the Arab countries, European civilization - the West - is wid=\r\nely hated. Matter of fact, quite a lot of Europeans and Americans hate it, =\r\ntoo, as you will know if you spend much time on college campuses.=20\r\nI can't see any strong reason for believing that if the state of Israel wer=\r\ne to disappear from the face of the earth tomorrow, hesperophobia would dis=\r\nappear with it. Not even just Arab hesperophobia would decline. A common wo=\r\nrd for Europeans in the Arabic language is feringji, from \"Frank,\" i.e. cru=\r\nsader. Arabs don't hate us because we support Israel. They hate us because =\r\nwe humiliated them, showed up the gross inferiority of their culture. To th=\r\nem, and similarly humiliated peoples, we are the other, detested and feared=\r\n in a way we can barely understand. Things got really bad in the 19th centu=\r\nry. When European society achieved industrial lift-off, Europeans were sudd=\r\nenly buzzing all over the world like a swarm of bees. They encountered thes=\r\ne other cultures, that had been vegetating in a quiet conviction of their o=\r\nwn superiority for centuries (or in the case of the Chinese, millennia). Wh=\r\nen these encounters occurred, the encountered culture collapsed in a cloud =\r\nof dust. Some of them, like the Turks, managed to reconstitute themselves a=\r\ns more or less modern nations; others, like the Arabs and the Chinese, are =\r\nstill struggling with the trauma of that encounter. Neither the Arabs nor t=\r\nhe Chinese, for example, have yet been able to attain rational, constitutio=\r\nnal government. For a devastating look at the paleolithic condition of poli=\r\ntics and society in the Arab world, I strongly recommend my colleague David=\r\n Pryce-Jones's book, The Closed Circle <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/A=\r\nSIN/0060981032/qid=3D1000382845/sr=3D1-12/ref=3Dsc_b_12/103-0202540-1179008=\r\n/nationalreviewon>.=20\r\n\r\nThe 1991 Gulf War showed how little has changed since those first encounter=\r\ns. Here were the armies of the West: swift, deadly, efficient, equipped and=\r\n organized, under the command of elected civilians at the head of a robust =\r\nand elaborate constitutional structure. And here were the Arabs: a shamblin=\r\ng, ill-nourished, shoeless rabble, led by a mad gangster-despot. (That was =\r\ntheir Arabs. There were also, of course, our Arabs - the Kuwaitis and Saudi=\r\ns, cowering in their plush-lined air-conditioned bunkers being waited on by=\r\n their Filipino servants while we did their fighting for them.) Final body =\r\ncounts: the West, 134 dead, the Arabs, 20,000 or more. The superiority of o=\r\nne culture over another has not been so starkly demonstrated since a handfu=\r\nl of British wooden ships, at the end of ten-thousand-mile lines of communi=\r\ncations, brought the Celestial Empire to its knees 150 years earlier. The C=\r\nhinese are still mad about that: They are still making angry, bitter movies=\r\n about the Opium Wars. A hundred and 50 years from now, the Arabs will not =\r\nhave forgotten the Gulf War.=20\r\nIf you haven't spent some time in its company, the depth, and bitterness of=\r\n hesperophobia in these cultures is hard to imagine. As Thomas Friedman poi=\r\nnts out in today's New York Times, Palestinian suicide bombers do not targe=\r\nt yeshivas, synagogues, or religious settlements. They go for shopping mall=\r\ns or Sbarro's outlets. Sure, they hate the Jews, but they hate the West as =\r\nmuch, or more.=20\r\nIsrael is not a cause of any of this, except to the degree that Israeli cul=\r\nture is essentially Western. If the present state of Israel were inhabited =\r\nby Christian Lithuanians or Frenchmen, the hatred would be nearly as intens=\r\ne. Nearly, not completely: Hatred of the Jews has been built into Arab-Mosl=\r\nem culture since the time of Mohammed. There is a tale you will hear from A=\r\nrab apologists that the Jews were contented and well treated in the old Ara=\r\nb-Moslem empires. This is nonsense: More often than not, they were treated =\r\nlike swine. For a true account, read Joan Peters's From Time Immemorial <ht=\r\ntp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0963624202/qid=3D1000384153/sr=3D1-1/r=\r\nef=3Dsc_b_1/103-0202540-1179008/nationalreviewon>, or Gil Carl Alroy Behind=\r\n the Middle East Crisis</a>. From the Arab point of view, Israel, or any We=\r\nstern state on \"Arab land,\" is an outrage, an illegitimate creation, a crus=\r\nader state. The fact that the Jews had a wealthy and powerful nation on tha=\r\nt land three thousand years ago counts for nothing. Israel is, from the poi=\r\nnt of view of most Arabs, an alien graft that must not be allowed to \"take.=\r\n\" It is a reminder of what can barely be thought of without acute psychic p=\r\nain: the squalid, hopeless, irredeemable inferiority of one's own culture b=\r\ny comparison with another.=20\r\nSo, so, so, is this any of America's business? What are we doing, meddling =\r\nin the Middle East? Where is our interest? Well, U.S. politicians must spea=\r\nk for themselves, but if I had any position of authority in any Western nat=\r\nion, I would be urging full support for Israel, and I am not Jewish. (Follo=\r\nwing my Passover column <http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshir=\r\ne041001.shtml>, in fact, a lot of NRO readers, along with at least one ex-e=\r\nditor of The New Republic, believe I am an anti-Semite.) It's a matter of c=\r\nultural solidarity. We of the West must hang together, or else we shall han=\r\ng separately. American isolationists simply do not understand how much we a=\r\nre hated in other places.=20\r\nWhat, after all, does the Buchananite program offer us, if carried through?=\r\n We have no troops in Israel to be withdrawn. If we withdraw our aid, the I=\r\nsraelis will be less able to defend themselves against the Arabs. Should we=\r\n just let the free market take over, U.S. arms manufacturers selling weapon=\r\ns to them cash on the nail? Apparently not: Several of my correspondents ha=\r\nve explained to me that what so enrages the Arabs is the sight of their peo=\r\nple being killed \"by American weapons.\" Oh. No weapons, then (and presumabl=\r\ny we should try to repatriate the ones they already have - lots of luck wit=\r\nh that, guys). But if we don't arm the Israelis, who will? While other hesp=\r\nerophobic countries - China, for example - are gleefully arming the Arabs a=\r\nnd other Israel-haters like Iran, and pocketing the profits?=20\r\nAnd the end of it all will be ... what? Inevitably, without our support, it=\r\n will be the destruction of Israel. They are so few, and the Arabs so many.=\r\n The Arabs will overwhelm that tiny state, and there will be such an orgy o=\r\nf massacre as has not been seen since the Rape of Nanking. And we shall be =\r\ndoing ... what? Watching it on our TVs, with a six-pack and a bucket of Nac=\r\nho chips in hand? That's the Buchananite vision? If so, it is a vision of c=\r\nowards and fools, and I want no part of it.=20\r\nIsrael's culture is ours. She is part of the West. If she goes down, we hav=\r\ne suffered a defeat, and the howling, jeering forces of barbarism have won =\r\na victory. You don't have to be Zionist, nor even Jewish, to support Israel=\r\n. You don't have to be in the pocket of the Israeli congressional lobbies, =\r\nor a suck-up to \"powerful pro-Zionist interests.\" You don't have to pretend=\r\n not to notice the occasional follies and cruelties of Israeli policy. You =\r\ndon't have to forget about the U.S.S. Liberty or Jonathan Pollard. You just=\r\n have to think straight. You just have to understand that the war between c=\r\nivilization and barbarism is being fought today just as it was fought at Ch=\r\nalons and Tours, at the gates of Kiev and Vienna, by the hoplites at Marath=\r\non and the legions on the Rhine. It is, as you have heard a thousand times,=\r\n this past few days, a war; and the thing about war is, you have to take si=\r\ndes, and close your eyes to your allies' imperfections for the duration. Th=\r\nere isn't any choice. What happened this week was not, or not only, an act =\r\nof anti-Americanism, anti-Israelism, or anti-Semitism. It was in part all t=\r\nhose things: but more than anything else, it was an act of hesperophobia.=\r\n=20\r\n###=20\r\n","content":"\nThe articles below provide excellent commentary on what we are up against. =\r\n Whether we like it or not history is littered with fallen empires and nati=\r\nons who have persecuted the Jews.  Israel, unlike us, at least until now, u=\r\nnderstands that it is in a war; a war for it's very survival; a war against=\r\n those who openly state that they do not consider Israel to have the right =\r\nto even exist.  But we know from the Bible that Israel will always exist an=\r\nd those who help the Jews, God will bless and those who hate the Jews, God =\r\nwill punish.  And even though we don't always agree with what Israel does, =\r\nthey are our friends, they know how to fight, and they are our allies in th=\r\nis War.\r\n=20\r\nIsrael knows they are in a fight for their very existence.  The same enemy =\r\nof the Jews hates America.  They hate America and the West for the very rea=\r\nsons outlined in the article below.  They are and have been openly at war w=\r\nith us for years.  Every American better understand that now! And if we don=\r\n't have the best intelligence service and the best armed forces in the worl=\r\nd we are going to continue to pay dearly.  Several years before World War T=\r\nwo, MacArthur, while Chief of Staff of the Army, stated that there was noth=\r\ning more expensive than a cheap army.  We can expand that today to include =\r\nall aspects of national security to include an intelligence apparatus neces=\r\nsary to penetrate enemy organizations.  The additional challenge we face is=\r\n in curbing the never ending desire for bigger and stronger government at t=\r\nhe expense of freedom.  Can we as a people vote in statesmen rather than po=\r\nliticians to fill the ranks of government?\r\n=20\r\nBut above and beyond all of this is the fact that the Christian (those who =\r\nbelieve in Jesus Christ - \"faith alone in Christ alone\" - for salvation) mu=\r\nst understand that Jesus Christ does control history and no matter what hap=\r\npens on the historical scene He will take care of us both in life and in de=\r\nath.    With that said, we need to make sure that as many of these terroris=\r\nts as possible meet \"allah\" very soon.\r\n=20\r\n=20\r\n----- Original Message -----=20\r\nFrom: Drexsmit@aol.com <mailto:Drexsmit@aol.com>=20\r\nTo: rgsu49a@email.msn.com <mailto:rgsu49a@email.msn.com> ; JCfirenze@aol.co=\r\nm <mailto:JCfirenze@aol.com> ; IBWriter@aol.com <mailto:IBWriter@aol.com> ;=\r\n Vegski@aol.com <mailto:Vegski@aol.com> ; eeasum@els.wylelabs.com <mailto:e=\r\neasum@els.wylelabs.com> ; Timothy_Escobar@ml.com <mailto:Timothy_Escobar@ml=\r\n.com> ; REvans6873@aol.com <mailto:REvans6873@aol.com> ; Wfedders@mtsac.edu=\r\n <mailto:Wfedders@mtsac.edu> ; Sohifriend@webtv.net <mailto:Sohifriend@webt=\r\nv.net> ; ihrke@mindspring.com <mailto:ihrke@mindspring.com> ; jkeeter@hmp.w=\r\nylelabs.com <mailto:jkeeter@hmp.wylelabs.com> ; vannkenn@yahoo.com <mailto:=\r\nvannkenn@yahoo.com> ; kendallstudio@yahoo.com <mailto:kendallstudio@yahoo.c=\r\nom> ; rlkenda@pacbell.net <mailto:rlkenda@pacbell.net> ; guy@streamtech.com=\r\n <mailto:guy@streamtech.com> ; llsells@att.net <mailto:llsells@att.net> ; C=\r\nlcrsvp@aol.com <mailto:Clcrsvp@aol.com> ; michelle.r.moore@bankamerica.com =\r\n<mailto:michelle.r.moore@bankamerica.com> ; dansam@attglobal.net <mailto:da=\r\nnsam@attglobal.net> ; prasmuss@mtsac.edu <mailto:prasmuss@mtsac.edu> ; ebs@=\r\ngte.net <mailto:ebs@gte.net> ; gshindo@prodigy.net <mailto:gshindo@prodigy.=\r\nnet> ; TONYSPLANS@aol.com <mailto:TONYSPLANS@aol.com> ; Andre.Smith@usoncol=\r\nogy.com <mailto:Andre.Smith@usoncology.com> ; ADSGTS@aol.com <mailto:ADSGTS=\r\n@aol.com> ; Jaqsmit@aol.com <mailto:Jaqsmit@aol.com> ; cspry@earthlink.com =\r\n<mailto:cspry@earthlink.com> ; kimkaw@yahoo.com <mailto:kimkaw@yahoo.com> ;=\r\n Dancuer@earthlink.net <mailto:Dancuer@earthlink.net> ; Superangell3@onebox=\r\n.com <mailto:Superangell3@onebox.com> ; bwheelock@hotmail.com <mailto:bwhee=\r\nlock@hotmail.com> ; revimar@earthlink.net <mailto:revimar@earthlink.net> ; =\r\ndick.wright@aepi.army.mil <mailto:dick.wright@aepi.army.mil>=20\r\nSent: Saturday, September 15, 2001 10:10 AM\r\nSubject: Worth a read (if you have time)\r\n\r\nAn interesting debate by folks that know far more that I about middle east =\r\nstuff.  M/ Petit and Charlie are both former analysts with one of our secur=\r\nity organizations and offer interesting insights.  If you are in the mood, =\r\nworth a read (start on the bottom article)...DLS=20\r\n =20\r\n\r\n\r\nComments by M/ Petit:=20\r\nIn response to several articles and comments I have received:=20\r\n\r\nRegarding the original article, I disagree with one of the points.   Jews w=\r\nere originally treated decently for a while within Islam.  As was women, un=\r\ntil the Arabs encountered the tradition of purdah in India. Mohammed incorp=\r\norated the Jewish prophets and have Jesus as one of  his prophets.=20\r\n\r\nAs to comments that our relationship with Israel is the basis of this confl=\r\nict, I disagree.   There is a perceived cultural divide on the part of the =\r\nfanatical Muslims.  The West is more representative of the devil's evil way=\r\ns.  We are to them to the pagans that Christian missionaries sought to conv=\r\nert.  However, conversion to Islam is usually done under the sword.  And it=\r\n goes deeper.  We have defeated the Islamic forces when we have engaged the=\r\nm.  And the Israelis have also done so.  The defeats have been so thorough =\r\nas to be humiliating.    =20\r\n\r\nIsrael must perceive itself as being independent.  Politically their leader=\r\n never could accept direct orders from another state.  But, note, one of th=\r\ne first countries to offer sympathy and support was Israel.  =20\r\nNote one thing.  Arabs started the slave trade.  Swahili is the language of=\r\n the Arab slave traders with their African business partners.  African Musl=\r\nims were buried in a separate section in a Muslim cemetery.  Farrakan and h=\r\nis followers wake up.=20\r\n\r\nPakistan has declared it would support the US with permitting overhead flig=\r\nhts.  The Afghanis are flooding out of their country.  The Afghan leaders a=\r\nre announcing that they are safe, don't worry.  The bottom line is that eve=\r\nn the Afghanis under the Taliban know who will win.=20\r\nWe have won the first skirmish in the War Against Terrorists.=20\r\n\r\nM/Petit=20\r\n\r\n-ubject: Re: Article on the Cause of the Attack=20\r\n\r\nInteresting historical presentation - good food for thought - I also refer =\r\nyou to page A-28 of the 15 September 2001 Washington Post.=20\r\n\r\nBush requests Shaon get on with talks with Arafat - Sharon says shove it up=\r\n your nose - is this a positive thinking member of the western world?  We s=\r\nend $4B a year to Israel to protect them as a nation and assist in keeping =\r\nthem in the \"modern\" world - It never hurts to talk to your adversaries -  =\r\neven if you talk while fighting.  The current disaster poses an opportunity=\r\n for both friends and allies to understand U.S. power.=20\r\n\r\nThoughts?=20\r\n\r\n  <http://www.nationalreview.com/images/page_2001_derbyshire-print.gif>\r\n\r\nHesperophobia=20\r\nOn blaming the Jews.=20\r\nMr. Derbyshire is also an NR contributing editor=20\r\nSeptember 13, 2001 5:00 p.m.=20\r\n\r\n =20\r\nBack in 1982 there were some horrible massacres at two Palestinian refugee =\r\ncamps in Lebanon. Christian Lebanese Arabs actually did the killing; but th=\r\ne Israeli army was in the neighborhood, and was responsible, at some theore=\r\ntical level, for keeping the peace in the zone that included the camps. Bec=\r\nause of this, the Israelis took much of the brunt of the world's outrage at=\r\n the killings. Commenting on these events, the Israeli Prime Minister, Mena=\r\nchem Begin, remarked in disgust: \"Goyim kill goyim, and they blame the Jews=\r\n!\"=20\r\nI've been getting the same feeling from some of my e-mail. The fundamental =\r\nreason America is under attack by Arab terrorists, several dozen people wan=\r\nt me to know, is that the U.S. supports Israel. And the only reason we do t=\r\nhat, several of them have said, or hinted, is because of the political powe=\r\nr of the Jewish lobby here in the U.S.A. A few of my correspondents have ex=\r\npressed themselves more ... bluntly than that. Put it this way: While I hav=\r\ne not yet encountered the word \"bloodsuckers\" (perhaps my readership isn't =\r\n\"diverse\" enough), some of this stuff comes pretty close - though I should =\r\nsay in fairness, most is argued on cold national-interest grounds. At any r=\r\nate, a lot of people feel that the mass killing of Americans by Arab terror=\r\nists is all the fault of Israel and those American politicians who, for low=\r\n and disreputable motives, or from sheer blindness to America's true ideals=\r\n and interests, support her. Goyim kill goyim, and they blame the Jews.=20\r\nSetting aside the statistical certainty that some of the dead Americans are=\r\n Jewish (as, in high statistical probability, some were of Arab origins), a=\r\nnd at the risk of yet more ill-tempered or abusive e-mails, I am going to d=\r\neclare that I don't think these recent outrages can be blamed on the Jews, =\r\nnor even on pro-Israel American politicians. The root phenomenon is not Ame=\r\nrican involvement in Middle Eastern affairs: The root phenomenon is hespero=\r\nphobia.=20\r\nThis word was coined by the political scientist Robert Conquest. Its roots =\r\nare the Greek words hesperos, which means \"the west\" and phobos, which mean=\r\ns \"fear,\" but which when used as an English suffix can also carry the meani=\r\nng \"hate.\" Hesperophobia is fear or hatred of the West. [While I'm in the c=\r\nlassical stuff, by the way, I committed a breach of good manners in my last=\r\n posting by inserting a Latin tag without translation. I am sorry. Oderint =\r\ndum metuant means \"Let them hate us, so long as they fear us.\" Seneca rebuk=\r\ned Cicero for saying it, though it seems to have been current among educate=\r\nd late-republican Romans.]=20\r\nHere is the news: A lot of people out there hate us. The name \"Durban\" mean=\r\n anything? In China, in India, in Pakistan, in Indonesia and Malaysia, in A=\r\nfrica, and in the Arab countries, European civilization - the West - is wid=\r\nely hated. Matter of fact, quite a lot of Europeans and Americans hate it, =\r\ntoo, as you will know if you spend much time on college campuses.=20\r\nI can't see any strong reason for believing that if the state of Israel wer=\r\ne to disappear from the face of the earth tomorrow, hesperophobia would dis=\r\nappear with it. Not even just Arab hesperophobia would decline. A common wo=\r\nrd for Europeans in the Arabic language is feringji, from \"Frank,\" i.e. cru=\r\nsader. Arabs don't hate us because we support Israel. They hate us because =\r\nwe humiliated them, showed up the gross inferiority of their culture. To th=\r\nem, and similarly humiliated peoples, we are the other, detested and feared=\r\n in a way we can barely understand. Things got really bad in the 19th centu=\r\nry. When European society achieved industrial lift-off, Europeans were sudd=\r\nenly buzzing all over the world like a swarm of bees. They encountered thes=\r\ne other cultures, that had been vegetating in a quiet conviction of their o=\r\nwn superiority for centuries (or in the case of the Chinese, millennia). Wh=\r\nen these encounters occurred, the encountered culture collapsed in a cloud =\r\nof dust. Some of them, like the Turks, managed to reconstitute themselves a=\r\ns more or less modern nations; others, like the Arabs and the Chinese, are =\r\nstill struggling with the trauma of that encounter. Neither the Arabs nor t=\r\nhe Chinese, for example, have yet been able to attain rational, constitutio=\r\nnal government. For a devastating look at the paleolithic condition of poli=\r\ntics and society in the Arab world, I strongly recommend my colleague David=\r\n Pryce-Jones's book, The Closed Circle <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/A=\r\nSIN/0060981032/qid=3D1000382845/sr=3D1-12/ref=3Dsc_b_12/103-0202540-1179008=\r\n/nationalreviewon>.=20\r\n\r\nThe 1991 Gulf War showed how little has changed since those first encounter=\r\ns. Here were the armies of the West: swift, deadly, efficient, equipped and=\r\n organized, under the command of elected civilians at the head of a robust =\r\nand elaborate constitutional structure. And here were the Arabs: a shamblin=\r\ng, ill-nourished, shoeless rabble, led by a mad gangster-despot. (That was =\r\ntheir Arabs. There were also, of course, our Arabs - the Kuwaitis and Saudi=\r\ns, cowering in their plush-lined air-conditioned bunkers being waited on by=\r\n their Filipino servants while we did their fighting for them.) Final body =\r\ncounts: the West, 134 dead, the Arabs, 20,000 or more. The superiority of o=\r\nne culture over another has not been so starkly demonstrated since a handfu=\r\nl of British wooden ships, at the end of ten-thousand-mile lines of communi=\r\ncations, brought the Celestial Empire to its knees 150 years earlier. The C=\r\nhinese are still mad about that: They are still making angry, bitter movies=\r\n about the Opium Wars. A hundred and 50 years from now, the Arabs will not =\r\nhave forgotten the Gulf War.=20\r\nIf you haven't spent some time in its company, the depth, and bitterness of=\r\n hesperophobia in these cultures is hard to imagine. As Thomas Friedman poi=\r\nnts out in today's New York Times, Palestinian suicide bombers do not targe=\r\nt yeshivas, synagogues, or religious settlements. They go for shopping mall=\r\ns or Sbarro's outlets. Sure, they hate the Jews, but they hate the West as =\r\nmuch, or more.=20\r\nIsrael is not a cause of any of this, except to the degree that Israeli cul=\r\nture is essentially Western. If the present state of Israel were inhabited =\r\nby Christian Lithuanians or Frenchmen, the hatred would be nearly as intens=\r\ne. Nearly, not completely: Hatred of the Jews has been built into Arab-Mosl=\r\nem culture since the time of Mohammed. There is a tale you will hear from A=\r\nrab apologists that the Jews were contented and well treated in the old Ara=\r\nb-Moslem empires. This is nonsense: More often than not, they were treated =\r\nlike swine. For a true account, read Joan Peters's From Time Immemorial <ht=\r\ntp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0963624202/qid=3D1000384153/sr=3D1-1/r=\r\nef=3Dsc_b_1/103-0202540-1179008/nationalreviewon>, or Gil Carl Alroy Behind=\r\n the Middle East Crisis</a>. From the Arab point of view, Israel, or any We=\r\nstern state on \"Arab land,\" is an outrage, an illegitimate creation, a crus=\r\nader state. The fact that the Jews had a wealthy and powerful nation on tha=\r\nt land three thousand years ago counts for nothing. Israel is, from the poi=\r\nnt of view of most Arabs, an alien graft that must not be allowed to \"take.=\r\n\" It is a reminder of what can barely be thought of without acute psychic p=\r\nain: the squalid, hopeless, irredeemable inferiority of one's own culture b=\r\ny comparison with another.=20\r\nSo, so, so, is this any of America's business? What are we doing, meddling =\r\nin the Middle East? Where is our interest? Well, U.S. politicians must spea=\r\nk for themselves, but if I had any position of authority in any Western nat=\r\nion, I would be urging full support for Israel, and I am not Jewish. (Follo=\r\nwing my Passover column <http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshir=\r\ne041001.shtml>, in fact, a lot of NRO readers, along with at least one ex-e=\r\nditor of The New Republic, believe I am an anti-Semite.) It's a matter of c=\r\nultural solidarity. We of the West must hang together, or else we shall han=\r\ng separately. American isolationists simply do not understand how much we a=\r\nre hated in other places.=20\r\nWhat, after all, does the Buchananite program offer us, if carried through?=\r\n We have no troops in Israel to be withdrawn. If we withdraw our aid, the I=\r\nsraelis will be less able to defend themselves against the Arabs. Should we=\r\n just let the free market take over, U.S. arms manufacturers selling weapon=\r\ns to them cash on the nail? Apparently not: Several of my correspondents ha=\r\nve explained to me that what so enrages the Arabs is the sight of their peo=\r\nple being killed \"by American weapons.\" Oh. No weapons, then (and presumabl=\r\ny we should try to repatriate the ones they already have - lots of luck wit=\r\nh that, guys). But if we don't arm the Israelis, who will? While other hesp=\r\nerophobic countries - China, for example - are gleefully arming the Arabs a=\r\nnd other Israel-haters like Iran, and pocketing the profits?=20\r\nAnd the end of it all will be ... what? Inevitably, without our support, it=\r\n will be the destruction of Israel. They are so few, and the Arabs so many.=\r\n The Arabs will overwhelm that tiny state, and there will be such an orgy o=\r\nf massacre as has not been seen since the Rape of Nanking. And we shall be =\r\ndoing ... what? Watching it on our TVs, with a six-pack and a bucket of Nac=\r\nho chips in hand? That's the Buchananite vision? If so, it is a vision of c=\r\nowards and fools, and I want no part of it.=20\r\nIsrael's culture is ours. She is part of the West. If she goes down, we hav=\r\ne suffered a defeat, and the howling, jeering forces of barbarism have won =\r\na victory. You don't have to be Zionist, nor even Jewish, to support Israel=\r\n. You don't have to be in the pocket of the Israeli congressional lobbies, =\r\nor a suck-up to \"powerful pro-Zionist interests.\" You don't have to pretend=\r\n not to notice the occasional follies and cruelties of Israeli policy. You =\r\ndon't have to forget about the U.S.S. Liberty or Jonathan Pollard. You just=\r\n have to think straight. You just have to understand that the war between c=\r\nivilization and barbarism is being fought today just as it was fought at Ch=\r\nalons and Tours, at the gates of Kiev and Vienna, by the hoplites at Marath=\r\non and the legions on the Rhine. It is, as you have heard a thousand times,=\r\n this past few days, a war; and the thing about war is, you have to take si=\r\ndes, and close your eyes to your allies' imperfections for the duration.

These energy producers,\nwhich include renewable sources such as windmill, solar and small hydro\nfacilities, may not have been able to fully participate in PJM's markets because\nof the capital equipment costs and investment in communications infrastructure.\nIn addition to the lower costs, small energy producers will benefit from the\n\"instant-on\" capabilities of the wireless communications network that allows for\nrapid deployment of new customer connections.\n\n \"PJM's partnership with Comverge Technologies supports our goal to continually\nstrengthen our technological capabilities so we can offer more choices to our\nmarket participants,\" said Phillip G.

Some of the\nbenefits for the user include: non-proprietary hardware/software interfaces;\nindustry standard protocols; economic equipment and communications costs;\nmultiple suppliers for customer equipment; rapid deployment; and modular\napproach. The technology allows PJM to communicate with a broad range of\nexternal customers and combine the acquisition of real time and revenue\ninformation into one system. In short, the program simplifies the complex task\nof interfacing to external customer equipment.\n\nPJM, the country's only fully functioning regional transmission organization,\noperates the world's largest competitive wholesale electricity market and one of\nNorth America's largest power grids. The company currently coordinates a pooled\ngenerating capacity of more than 58,000 megawatts and operates a wholesale\nelectricity market with more than 200 market buyers, sellers and traders of\nelectricity. PJM has administered more than $5 billion in energy and energy\nservice trades since the regional markets opened in 1997. More than 70 nations\nhave sent delegates to PJM to learn about the market model and the operation of\nthe grid in the mid-Atlantic states.

So...\nCHORUS\nWhy, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the sky\nthen the bond market went dry and them good ol' boys were high on their own\nsupply wailing, \"Why Ask Why\",  This will be the day that they  drink Bud\nDry.\nDid you write off your shares enough or did you have faith in Jeff above,\nif the headlines told you so, and do you believe in book-it-n'-roll, can mark\nto market save your p&l and can you teach me how to print money on deal\nflow? Well I know that you're in not in ruin I saw your balance in the\ncredit union, you sold off all your shares and I dig those market bears. He\nwas a lonely boomer CEO with a big old House in River O.  but I knew I was\nout some dough, the day, Jeff stepped aside. I started singin...\nChorus\n\nNow for ten years we've been on a roll and all are friends are on the dole\nbut that's not how it used to be, when the Ken Lay sang for the George and\nBarb while Rice screwed Amanda in an rental from Harold Farb,  oh and while\nSkilling was looking down, the stock price has made him frown the\nshareholder return, has really made him burn, and while he had plenty of\njack, he had lost the knack and had come under attack, , the day, Jeff\nstepped aside.

The Facility Services Group is expanding its vendor management platform to allow service technicians to focus on efficient, predictable service while capturing data on a real time basis and will provide scalable execution capability for the vendor management and O&M products.

The Management Team of the Facility Services Group will include existing management from these companies.\n\nFieldCentrix is a leading provider of wireless, Internet-based field force automation software.  Founded in 1994, the 125-employee company was recently named one of Frontline Solutions Top 100 companies and also received the Cingular Best Solution award for 2001.

The Construction Services Group will continue to provide Engineering and Construction Services to Third Parties and EES.  We expect this group to continue to be an important and valuable part of EES's financial performance.\n\nDave Whaley will continue to manage the shared services groups, including legal, finance, HR, and IT, across The Facility Services Group and The Construction Services Group.  The centralization and sharing of these support services is cost effective, scalable and responsive.  In addition, Dave will assist in the transition of the EFS companies to The Facility Services Group.\n\nJoe Earle has decided to leave Enron at the end of this year.

Under his leadership, EFS and all of its companies have continued to be leaders in their fields.  Please join us in thanking Joe for his 10 years of leadership with the EFS companies.  \nThe re-alignment of our activities and the creation of a new entity to focus solely on serving the $136 billion facility services market will assist our entire organization in achieving our 2002 and beyond goals and objectives.","messageId":"<12723452.1075858664349.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-10-16T23:35:42+05:30","from":"chairman.ees@enron.com","subject":"Formation of The Facility Services Group and The Construction","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"EES Office of Chairman, </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=50BFCCF3-CEC46D5B-862565D4-56F959>","xTo":"All EES@ENRON","xFolder":"\\RRING (Non-Privileged)\\PersonalFolder","xOrigin":"Ring-R","xFileName":"RRING (Non-Privileged)1.pst"}

(\"EESI\") submitted application to become a NEPO=\r\nOL member, to be effective January 1, 2000.  EESI was approved by the NEPOO=\r\nL Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January 24, 2000 meeting.  On=\r\ne requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po=\r\nlicy for NEPOOL Members.  EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Powe=\r\nr Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the =\r\nFinancial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than =\r\ncorporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate =\r\nGuaranty required by NEPOOL.\r\n\r\nEESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in th=\r\ne amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in J=\r\nune 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New =\r\nEngland dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements)=\r\n and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's cu=\r\nrrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th=\r\ne amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  Becky d=\r\nelivered the October 10th letter  to my attention whereby I took the letter=\r\n to EESI Legal Department (Karen Cordova) and informed Karen that EESI need=\r\ned to increase the Performance Bond to $20,000,000.  Karen requested Credit=\r\n Department (Nichole Gunter) initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t=\r\no the $20,000,000 level; to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati=\r\non with Credit Department was October 12, 2001.  In telephone conversations=\r\n with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE t=\r\nhat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r=\r\nesolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (Oc=\r\ntober 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such.=20\r\n\r\nI was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond compa=\r\nny Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance=\r\n Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin=\r\ng invoices for \"other\" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $1=\r\n50,000.  The \"other\" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI=\r\n, since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, J=\r\neff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.  Payments for the \"=\r\nother\" performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque=\r\nst for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, which w=\r\nas issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on Octo=\r\nber 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October =\r\n23, 2001.  EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to =\r\nresolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond =\r\ncompany as mentioned above.  Credit Department personnel informed ISO-NE pe=\r\nrsonnel that EESI would not meet the October 19, 2001 deadline, but was wor=\r\nking diligently to resolve the matter; Credit Department personnel sent via=\r\n FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor=\r\nmance Bond to ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001. =20\r\n\r\nI notified Dan Allegretti, (Enron Government Affairs & Chariman, NEPOOL Par=\r\nticipants Committee) of the entire situation prior to October 19, 2001.  Da=\r\nn indicated that he did not think there would be any problems, but to get t=\r\nhe matter resolved as quickly as possible. Dan advised me that the implicat=\r\nions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t=\r\nhe Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published, the=\r\n following month, EESI would no longer be listed as being in default.  On O=\r\nctober 19, 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) f=\r\nrom Edward McKenna, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer informing EESI=\r\n that \"Enron Energy Services, Inc. has not maintained the required level of=\r\n financial assurance for 10 days or more, and has had a total combination o=\r\nf 3 financial assurance and/or payment defaults in the last 12 months, whic=\r\nh qualifies them as having 2 (two) Level 1 defaults.  The ISO has been in c=\r\nontact with Enron Energy Services, Inc. through multiple telephone communic=\r\nations, and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured.  Th=\r\nerefore, per the established procedure, we are forwarding this information =\r\nto the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them.\"  According to Da=\r\nn Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him, as Chariman of the=\r\n Members Subcommittee, and he would discuss the issue with them.  The previ=\r\nous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October 19, 2001 letter =\r\noccurred (i) December 2000, when payment was received 1-2 days late and was=\r\n automatically resolved when payment was received and (ii) September 2001, =\r\nwhen Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market a=\r\nctivity.  To the best of my knowledge, EESI was unaware of either the Decem=\r\nber 2000 Payment Default or the September 2001 Financial Assurance Default,=\r\n and no information was received by EESI from ISO-NE relative to either inc=\r\nidence.\r\n\r\nAccording to (i) Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proce=\r\nedings and (ii) conversations with Dan Allegretti, the issue should be reso=\r\nlved with the receipt on October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE=\r\n.

EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Powe=\r\nr Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the =\r\nFinancial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than =\r\ncorporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate =\r\nGuaranty required by NEPOOL.\r\n\r\nEESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in th=\r\ne amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in J=\r\nune 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New =\r\nEngland dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements)=\r\n and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's cu=\r\nrrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th=\r\ne amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.

In telephone conversations=\r\n with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE t=\r\nhat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r=\r\nesolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (Oc=\r\ntober 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such.=20\r\n\r\nI was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond compa=\r\nny Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance=\r\n Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin=\r\ng invoices for \"other\" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $1=\r\n50,000.  The \"other\" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI=\r\n, since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, J=\r\neff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.

For the one project that has come on line during the non-performance penalty could be in the range of $150,000 to $640,000, depending on the resoultion of the \"effective online date\" for said project.  The non-performance penalty was our strongest negotiating point in the ongoing effort to restructure the agreement as there is a potential for penalties for each project for each year of the contract.  The agreement contained some fundamenal flaws in order to be able to book the mark-to-market for the agreement.  \n\nI do not have a good handle of the \"early termination payment\" except to say that there are approxmiately 390,500 MWh's.  The average contract \"fixed price\" is $33.10 MWh.  I would need to find out what the nine year fixed price from the power curves is to estimate but my best stab would be to estimate the nine year fixed price to be $25.00 MWh which would result in \"early termination payment\" of approximately $3,200,000 ((390,500*33.10) - (390,500*25.00)).\n\nRichard  \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSmith, Mike D.  \nSent:\tTuesday, January 29, 2002 3:25 PM\nTo:\tRing, Richard\nSubject:\tRE: Riverside County Waste Mgt \n\nThanks.

Based on our bankruptcy filing RCWMD stopped delivery of power on December 6, 2001; RCWMD invoiced EESI for power production for September 2001, 0ctober 2001 and November 2001.  I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI.  I do not know of any invoice for the first six days of December 2001.\n\nEESI (myself) and EPMI (Chris Foster) were in the process of renegotiating the above referenced agreement with the plan for EPMI to take over the purchase of power and scheduling services with EESI being the purchaser of the \"green tickets\"  from EPMI associated with the power production.  There were some major issues to overcome in the renegotiation regarding the \"fixed price\", \"volume committments\" and \"penalties\".  I do not know who, if anyone, is currently looking at this agreement to make any kind of determination EESI's and/or EPMI's desires for the future of this agreement.  \n\nRCWMD sent various letters dated December 10, 2001, December 13, 2001, and January 8, 2002 requesting response from EESI.  The December 10, 2001 letter indicates that RCWMD considers the agreement terminated effective December 2, 2001.  I had previously spoke to you about this agreement in December 2001.  \n\nIt is my opinion that we should not continue this agreement and we should consider RCWMD's offer to terminate the agreement with the exchange of the non-performance panalties for the termination payment.\n\nLet me know if you need anything else.\n\nRegards,\n\nRichard\n\n   \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSmith, Mike D.  \nSent:\tTuesday, January 29, 2002 12:36 PM\nTo:\tRing, Richard\nSubject:\tRiverside County Waste Mgt \n\nRichard--what do you know about this deal?
