{"rawContent":"\nYesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in \"Schedule\" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.\n\nI don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it \"right\" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.\n\nRegards,\nTim\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tPostlethwaite, John  \nSent:\tTuesday, January 08, 2002 1:10 PM\nTo:\tReeves, Leslie; Calger, Christopher F.; White, Stacey W.; Belden, Tim\nCc:\tScholtes, Diana; Semperger, Cara\nSubject:\tDec and Jan liquidations\n\nIt has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled.

Here are some high points:\n\nFERC issues an order rejecting the proposed amendment to the CAISO creditworthiness provisions, and granting in part the complaint of the generators in the docket (which we supported).  The CAISO is ordered to enforce the existing creditworthiness provisions of its tariff and invoice CDWR for transactions with the non-creditworthy IOUs, within 15 days.  Otherwise, FERC will seek injunctive relief in court to enforce its order.  Also, a creditworthy party must be provided and bills paid, otherwise, the must offer requirement will be suspended (applies to California).

{"rawContent":"\nNames of the 5 people fired disclosed below:\n\n\n5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests.\nJEFFREY L. RABIN; DARYL KELLEY; RICH CONNELL\nTIMES STAFF WRITERS\n\n07/28/2001\nLos Angeles Times\nHome Edition\nA-1\nCopyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company\n\nThe Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances. \nA sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, according to state records.\nAll were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned. \nIn addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled. \nTop advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants \"may have crossed the line,\" said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. \nState law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests. \nAlthough portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings. \nAmong them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state bond sale in U.S. history. \nThe New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the $12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines. \nDavis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws. Critics question the distinction. \n\"The governor's approach may be convenient for him,\" said Jim Knox, executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, \"but it ignores the law.\" \nDisclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that \"decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest,\" Knox said. \"Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing.\" \nThe firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year. \nMore than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according to state records. \nIn the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws. \nIt took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. \nEven with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to state when they bought the energy stocks. \nOne of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the governor of \"a conscious policy of secrecy\" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. \n4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine \nThe four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. \nWhile working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records available. \n\"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks,\" the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an interview. \nThe highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power and negotiating contracts, records show. \nA former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could not be reached for comment. \nThe governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times. \nAll of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of California's electricity deregulation. \nHired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California. \nMead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago. \nHe said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value each time. \nMead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team Thursday and fired. \n\"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't give me an answer,\" Mead said. \"[He] just said your services are terminated. \n\"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns.\" \nAdministration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. \nGriffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, in her final days working at the electricity exchange. \nA few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. \nOn Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. \nThe state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years. \nIn addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. \nAnother consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation. \nBernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb. 28. \nPurchase of Enron Stock Defended \n\"I don't see a conflict,\" he said. \"At the time, we weren't really dealing with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron.\" \nBarretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job. \nThat notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. \n\"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards,\" he wrote. \"That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters.\" \n\"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person.\" \nHowever, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. \nDavis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects. \nFichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the record. \nFichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. \nPact Specifies Financial Advice \nThe state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. \nThe decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like the other two firms, it too was hired to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. \nThat firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power company interests. \nThe governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract.\n\nPHOTO: Barry Goode, above, governor's legal affairs secretary.; \n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Docket No. ER01-2103-000\n\n\nORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT           PREJUDICE\n\n                           (Issued July 20, 2001)\n\n          In this order we reject, without prejudice, proposed\n     amendments of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) and Portland\n     General Electric (PGE) to their respective market-based rate\n     tariffs that would allow them to make inter-affiliate sales using\n     the EnronOnline trading platform.\n\n     I.   Background\n\n          On May 22, 2001, in separate filings, affiliates PGE in\n     Docket No. ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No. ER01-2103-000\n     (collectively Applicants) filed to amend their respective market-\n     based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through\n     the EnronOnline trading platform, and to prohibit communication\n     among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on\n     EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on\n                 1\n     EnronOnline.   This amendment does not supplant the existing\n     provisions of PGE's and EPMI's currently effective tariffs which\n     allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the\n     Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there\n     are captive customers, e.g., allowing a public utility to sell to\n     its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower\n     than the rate it charges non-affiliates, requiring simultaneous\n     offers to non-affiliates, or requiring use of a relevant,\n     established index.  Rather, PGE and EPMI propose to amend their\n     respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make\n\n               1\n                The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks,\n          an Enron Corp. subsidiary.  EnronOnline is a free, Internet-\n          based, transaction system which allows EPMI's customers to view\n          real time prices from EPMI's traders and transact instantly\n          online.  EnronOnline is not an EPMI application, but rather\n          EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in\n          buying from and selling power to third parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -2-\n          and ER01-2103-000\n\n     inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline, with restrictions\n     different than those in place but that, they state, will still\n     prevent affiliate abuse.  Applicants state that the Commission's\n     requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in\n     electronic commerce and, in particular, the Commission's\n     requirement that \"PGE post on its website notice of a potential\n     purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the\n     transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline, since\n     EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not\n     provide for a waiting period before consummating the\n                  2\n     transaction.\"   According to Applicants, this deprives PGE of the\n     ability to buy or sell power \"from perhaps the largest marketer\n                                                                3\n     in its region, to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers.\"\n\n     II.  Notice of Filing and Interventions/Protests\n\n          Notices of the filings were published in the Federal\n     Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 29,939 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2097-000),\n     and 66 Fed. Reg. 30,180 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2103-000), with\n     motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before\n     June 12, 2001.  None was filed.\n\n     III. Discussion\n\n          The Commission allows power marketers and their public\n     utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates\n     when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate\n     abuse.  As the Commission has explained, affiliate abuse can\n     occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers\n     sells power at below-market prices to, or purchases power at\n     above-market prices from, an affiliate without captive customers\n     (such as a power marketer affiliate).  One way in which the\n     Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization\n     by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate\n                                                             4\n     sales at an established, relevant market price or index.\n     Another way, when there is no assurance that the affiliates are\n     transacting at the prevailing market price, is to adopt various\n     conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent\n                     5\n     affiliate abuse.\n\n               2\n                EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4.\n               3\n                EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4.\n               4\n                See, e.g., DPL Energy, Inc. 90 FERC   61,200 (2000);\n          accord, First Energy Trading Services, Inc., 88 FERC   61,067 at\n          61,156 (1999).\n               5\n                E.g., GPU Advanced Resources, Inc., 81 FERC   61,335 at\n                                                        (continued...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -3-\n          and ER01-2103-000\n\n\n          Here, Applicants request that the Commission permit them to\n     use EnronOnline to make inter-affiliate sales, subject to the\n     following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient\n     protection against affiliate abuse.  PGE, when buying from EPMI\n     using EnronOnline, will be required to \"take the transaction\n     price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular\n                                                              6\n     location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment.\"   In\n                                                                  7\n     addition, PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders  or\n     engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity\n     of the counter-party is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction\n     being finalized.  Applicants also propose to amend their\n     respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication\n     regarding prices posted on EnronOnline.\n\n          Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate\n     abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at\n\n          5\n           (...continued)\n          62,539 (1997) (GPU); Detroit Edison Company, 80 FERC   61,348 at\n          62,197-98 (1997) (Detroit Edison).  In GPU, the Commission\n          allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional\n          public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate\n          the public utility paid non-affiliates under certain standard\n          supplier agreements.  Accord, First Energy Trading & Power\n          Marketing, Inc., 84 FERC   61,214 at 62,037-38, reh'g denied, 85\n          FERC   61,311 (1998).  Detroit Edison provided that a traditional\n          public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer\n          only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-\n          affiliates; that the utility simultaneously offer through its\n          electronic bulletin board to sell to non-affiliates at the same\n          rate offered to its affiliate; and that all prices charged to the\n          affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin\n          board.  Accord, Jersey Central Power & Light Co., 82 FERC\n          61,023 at 61,071 (1998); Commonwealth Edison Co., 85 FERC\n          61,288 at 62,176-77 (1998).\n               6\n                EPMI Application at 4; PGE Application at 5.\n               7\n                In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline, EPMI would\n          know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or\n          lower than that currently available.  Applications at 3.  While\n          Applicants do not define \"Limit Order,\" the common understanding\n          is that, unlike a market order, which instructs a broker to\n          transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in\n          the marketplace, a limit order instructs a broker to fill the\n          order only if certain conditions are met.  Generally, a limit\n          order may be either a day order, in which case it expires when\n          the market closes if unfilled, or good-until-canceled, in which\n          case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -4-\n          and ER01-2103-000\n\n     the posted price (a price that is offered to all market\n     participants) and there will be no transactions in which EPMI\n     knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is\n     finalized.  Thus, Applicants contend that not only will PGE be\n     unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline,\n     but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE.\n     Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by\n     computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of\n     PGE.  In addition, because the EnronOnline price is posted\n     electronically and is available to all market participants,\n     Applicants state that PGE's customers have the opportunity to\n     transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and\n     conditions that are available to PGE.\n\n          Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed\n     restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the\n     Commission's affiliate abuse requirements and conditions (e.g.,\n     protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its\n                                           8\n     transactions with its affiliate EPMI).   The thrust of\n     Applicants' argument is that the Commission's affiliate abuse\n     concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline, a public medium, for\n     selling power between affiliates.  We disagree.  While perhaps\n     faster and easier to use than phone calls, faxes, or letters, an\n     Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade, and\n     speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commission's\n     affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied.  There is, for\n     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline\n                                        9\n     represent prevailing market prices.\n\n          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI\n     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no\n     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted\n     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the\n     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an\n     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result\n     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,\n     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to\n     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI\n                          10\n     is willing to buy at.    For other transactions through media\n     other than EnronOnline, including other exchanges, EPMI might be\n\n               8\n                See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text (citing cases\n          that discuss Commission's underlying concerns with affiliate\n          power sales).\n               9\n                See supra note 4 and accompanying text.\n               10\n                 All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a\n          participant.  For sales, EPMI is the seller.  For purchases, EPMI\n          is the buyer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -5-\n          and ER01-2103-000\n                                                              11\n     willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices.\n     Moreover, Applicants provide no information about how product\n     prices posted by EPMI are determined, or whether there would be\n     any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via\n     EnronOnline, or even whether there are other similar, but non-\n     affiliated, Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically\n     trade those products to attain similar benefits.\n\n          Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be\n     transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline, we now\n     turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions\n     established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse.\n     Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE\n     through EnronOnline, there is nothing in the Applicants' proposed\n     restrictions that would require PGE to\n     simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate\n     offered to the affiliate.  The Commission requires that, with\n     respect to any power offered to its affiliate, PGE make the same\n     offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its\n     electronic bulletin board.  But it is unclear whether PGE can or\n     will make the same offer to non-affiliates.\n\n          Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited\n     from submitting Limit Orders, which would prevent EPMI from\n     knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction.  Again,\n     this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above-\n     market prices.\n\n          The Commission is not assured by the Applicants' proposal\n     that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline\n     will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commission's\n     expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for\n     inter-affiliate power sales transactions.

Docket No. ER01-2103-000\n\n\nORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT           PREJUDICE\n\n                           (Issued July 20, 2001)\n\n          In this order we reject, without prejudice, proposed\n     amendments of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) and Portland\n     General Electric (PGE) to their respective market-based rate\n     tariffs that would allow them to make inter-affiliate sales using\n     the EnronOnline trading platform.\n\n     I.   Background\n\n          On May 22, 2001, in separate filings, affiliates PGE in\n     Docket No. ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No. ER01-2103-000\n     (collectively Applicants) filed to amend their respective market-\n     based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through\n     the EnronOnline trading platform, and to prohibit communication\n     among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on\n     EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on\n                 1\n     EnronOnline.   This amendment does not supplant the existing\n     provisions of PGE's and EPMI's currently effective tariffs which\n     allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the\n     Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there\n     are captive customers, e.g., allowing a public utility to sell to\n     its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower\n     than the rate it charges non-affiliates, requiring simultaneous\n     offers to non-affiliates, or requiring use of a relevant,\n     established index.  Rather, PGE and EPMI propose to amend their\n     respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make\n\n               1\n                The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks,\n          an Enron Corp. subsidiary.  EnronOnline is a free, Internet-\n          based, transaction system which allows EPMI's customers to view\n          real time prices from EPMI's traders and transact instantly\n          online.  EnronOnline is not an EPMI application, but rather\n          EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in\n          buying from and selling power to third parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -2-\n          and ER01-2103-000\n\n     inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline, with restrictions\n     different than those in place but that, they state, will still\n     prevent affiliate abuse.  Applicants state that the Commission's\n     requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in\n     electronic commerce and, in particular, the Commission's\n     requirement that \"PGE post on its website notice of a potential\n     purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the\n     transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline, since\n     EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not\n     provide for a waiting period before consummating the\n                  2\n     transaction.\"   According to Applicants, this deprives PGE of the\n     ability to buy or sell power \"from perhaps the largest marketer\n                                                                3\n     in its region, to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers.\"\n\n     II.  Notice of Filing and Interventions/Protests\n\n          Notices of the filings were published in the Federal\n     Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 29,939 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2097-000),\n     and 66 Fed. Reg. 30,180 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2103-000), with\n     motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before\n     June 12, 2001.  None was filed.\n\n     III. Discussion\n\n          The Commission allows power marketers and their public\n     utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates\n     when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate\n     abuse.  As the Commission has explained, affiliate abuse can\n     occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers\n     sells power at below-market prices to, or purchases power at\n     above-market prices from, an affiliate without captive customers\n     (such as a power marketer affiliate).  One way in which the\n     Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization\n     by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate\n                                                             4\n     sales at an established, relevant market price or index.\n     Another way, when there is no assurance that the affiliates are\n     transacting at the prevailing market price, is to adopt various\n     conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent\n                     5\n     affiliate abuse.\n\n               2\n                EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4.\n               3\n                EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4.\n               4\n                See, e.g., DPL Energy, Inc. 90 FERC   61,200 (2000);\n          accord, First Energy Trading Services, Inc., 88 FERC   61,067 at\n          61,156 (1999).\n               5\n                E.g., GPU Advanced Resources, Inc., 81 FERC   61,335 at\n                                                        (continued...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -3-\n          and ER01-2103-000\n\n\n          Here, Applicants request that the Commission permit them to\n     use EnronOnline to make inter-affiliate sales, subject to the\n     following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient\n     protection against affiliate abuse.  PGE, when buying from EPMI\n     using EnronOnline, will be required to \"take the transaction\n     price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular\n                                                              6\n     location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment.\"   In\n                                                                  7\n     addition, PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders  or\n     engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity\n     of the counter-party is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction\n     being finalized.  Applicants also propose to amend their\n     respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication\n     regarding prices posted on EnronOnline.\n\n          Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate\n     abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at\n\n          5\n           (...continued)\n          62,539 (1997) (GPU); Detroit Edison Company, 80 FERC   61,348 at\n          62,197-98 (1997) (Detroit Edison).  In GPU, the Commission\n          allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional\n          public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate\n          the public utility paid non-affiliates under certain standard\n          supplier agreements.  Accord, First Energy Trading & Power\n          Marketing, Inc., 84 FERC   61,214 at 62,037-38, reh'g denied, 85\n          FERC   61,311 (1998).  Detroit Edison provided that a traditional\n          public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer\n          only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-\n          affiliates; that the utility simultaneously offer through its\n          electronic bulletin board to sell to non-affiliates at the same\n          rate offered to its affiliate; and that all prices charged to the\n          affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin\n          board.  Accord, Jersey Central Power & Light Co., 82 FERC\n          61,023 at 61,071 (1998); Commonwealth Edison Co., 85 FERC\n          61,288 at 62,176-77 (1998).\n               6\n                EPMI Application at 4; PGE Application at 5.\n               7\n                In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline, EPMI would\n          know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or\n          lower than that currently available.  Applications at 3.  While\n          Applicants do not define \"Limit Order,\" the common understanding\n          is that, unlike a market order, which instructs a broker to\n          transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in\n          the marketplace, a limit order instructs a broker to fill the\n          order only if certain conditions are met.  Generally, a limit\n          order may be either a day order, in which case it expires when\n          the market closes if unfilled, or good-until-canceled, in which\n          case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -4-\n          and ER01-2103-000\n\n     the posted price (a price that is offered to all market\n     participants) and there will be no transactions in which EPMI\n     knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is\n     finalized.  Thus, Applicants contend that not only will PGE be\n     unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline,\n     but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE.\n     Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by\n     computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of\n     PGE.  In addition, because the EnronOnline price is posted\n     electronically and is available to all market participants,\n     Applicants state that PGE's customers have the opportunity to\n     transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and\n     conditions that are available to PGE.\n\n          Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed\n     restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the\n     Commission's affiliate abuse requirements and conditions (e.g.,\n     protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its\n                                           8\n     transactions with its affiliate EPMI).   The thrust of\n     Applicants' argument is that the Commission's affiliate abuse\n     concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline, a public medium, for\n     selling power between affiliates.  We disagree.  While perhaps\n     faster and easier to use than phone calls, faxes, or letters, an\n     Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade, and\n     speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commission's\n     affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied.  There is, for\n     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline\n                                        9\n     represent prevailing market prices.\n\n          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI\n     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no\n     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted\n     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the\n     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an\n     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result\n     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,\n     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to\n     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI\n                          10\n     is willing to buy at.    For other transactions through media\n     other than EnronOnline, including other exchanges, EPMI might be\n\n               8\n                See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text (citing cases\n          that discuss Commission's underlying concerns with affiliate\n          power sales).\n               9\n                See supra note 4 and accompanying text.\n               10\n                 All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a\n          participant.  For sales, EPMI is the seller.  For purchases, EPMI\n          is the buyer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -5-\n          and ER01-2103-000\n                                                              11\n     willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices.\n     Moreover, Applicants provide no information about how product\n     prices posted by EPMI are determined, or whether there would be\n     any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via\n     EnronOnline, or even whether there are other similar, but non-\n     affiliated, Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically\n     trade those products to attain similar benefits.\n\n          Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be\n     transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline, we now\n     turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions\n     established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse.\n     Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE\n     through EnronOnline, there is nothing in the Applicants' proposed\n     restrictions that would require PGE to\n     simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate\n     offered to the affiliate.  The Commission requires that, with\n     respect to any power offered to its affiliate, PGE make the same\n     offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its\n     electronic bulletin board.  But it is unclear whether PGE can or\n     will make the same offer to non-affiliates.\n\n          Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited\n     from submitting Limit Orders, which would prevent EPMI from\n     knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction.  Again,\n     this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above-\n     market prices.\n\n          The Commission is not assured by the Applicants' proposal\n     that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline\n     will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commission's\n     expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for\n     inter-affiliate power sales transactions.  There is, for example,\n     no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how\n     unaffiliated customers, or other interested parties, would\n     monitor inter-affiliate transactions.\n\n          For the above reasons, we will reject the proposed\n     amendments, without prejudice to Applicants revising their\n     proposal to address the Commission's concerns and incorporating\n     appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               11\n                 Likewise, PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and\n          sell at higher prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Docket Nos.

{"rawContent":"\nI am told that due to the lack of settlement the Judge will recommend a refund based on a proxy MCP wherein there will be a daily or hourly heat rate multiplied by a DAILY gas price + O&M.  Emission costs would be justfied on a generator-specific basis.\n\nThe refund would only look at transactions 2 Oct. 00 - 19 June 01.

Each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost. \n\n\"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps,\" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park. \n\nAckerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect. \n\n\"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not having enough,\" Ackerman said. \"It increases the threat of blackouts.\" \n\n\nBLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED\nCalifornia authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert about an hour later, after finding additional supplies. \n\n\"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts,\" said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power network. \n\nThe Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights. \n\nDon Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Monday's shortage. \n\n\"We're looking very closely at this,\" he said. \"There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences.\" \n\nSpecifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing, under capped prices. \n\n\"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this,\" he said. \n\nThe federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92 per megawatt hour.

{"rawContent":"\nJust in case you didn't see this,\nPacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO Mandate\nBy Bryan Lee\n\n10/04/2001\nDow Jones Energy Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nOF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\nWASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region.\nThe House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO. \nThe lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region's consumers. \nFERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-benefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort. \nSpeaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that \"a bunch of bureaucrats\" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of \"what it does for local reliability.\" \nDeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing. \nThe region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network, thanks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, according to hearing testimony expressing concern that RTO West, as the RTO proposed for the region is called, will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefits. \n\"We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for end-use consumers in the Northwest,\" the Public Power Council testified. \"Although work is beginning on a cost-benefit study, we are troubled that a transmission system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled because FERC has announced that RTOs, by definition, are good.\" \n\"Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmission ills in other regions of the country, but not in the Northwest,\" declared a group of transmission-dependent utilities. \n\"The 'balkanization' and isolation of transmission systems that characterize most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest. For this reason, the economic power-side benefits of an RTO will be relatively small,\" said a group of aluminum producers. \nSimilar cost-benefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators in the Eastern U.S. who oppose FERC's effort to consolidate grid assets under large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast. \n'RTO Week' \n\nFERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday, adding that he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during \"RTO Week\" Oct. 15, when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the commission's RTO mandate. \n\"I think I need the decisionmakers at the table. We've had the lawyers in the suits arguing about it for eight years now,\" Wood said at an \"energy community\" forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington, Va. \nWood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a cost-benefit analysis at its Sept. 26 meeting. \nThe commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of its claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will translate into consumer savings. \nWood also noted a study by Mirant Corp. (MIR), which concluded that combining the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO would produce $440 million in annual consumer benefits. \nDuring the Enron forum, Edward Meyers, a regulator with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, urged Wood to seek out the input of affected state regulators. \nMeyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in supporting the Northeast RTO grid-consolidation, while most others oppose the effort as \"economically dangerous.\" \nArnetta McRae, chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission, told Wood that her fellow state regulators aren't so much opposed to grid regionalization but the lack of consultation by FERC. \nThe state regulators want \"an opportunity to be at the table,\" McRae said. If such a process were offered, there would be a lot less opposition, she predicted. \nFERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators, Wood said, adding that he was \"blindsided\" by the opposition among state regulators to FERC's grid-consolidation mandate. \nLater in the day, Wood told reporters that \"RTO Week\" will feature an entire hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators. \nAt the Enron forum, Wood defended the commission's RTO policy, which calls for carving up the nation's interconnected electricity system under the control of four or five large RTOs, as necessary to jump-start the overly long transition from regulation to competition. \n\"This process needs to be goosed,\" said Wood, calling FERC's RTO orders \"an external catalyst\" to get the process moving. \n\"If I'm wrong, I'd love to find a better way around that,\" he said. \n-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com\n\nDavid F.

{"rawContent":"\nThe following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission meeting held yesterday and additional intelligence gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting.  We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues. Generally, the order is expected to expand the scope of the Commission's April 26 Order, and this report will highlight the differences.\n\nGeographical Scope-  Mitigation is extended to cover all 11 western states.\n\nTerm- The term of the order will be extended to cover 2 summers.  We expect the order to issue today.  If so, the order will take effect at midnight tonight and continue in effect until 9/30/02.\n\nSpot Market- Defined as sales of 24 hours or less, transacted on the day of delivery or the day prior to delivery.\n\nMust Sell- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will require all sellers to offer all their available power in real time.  All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market.   Sellers in the rest of the WSCC are similarly required to sell, except that they are not required to sell into California and can choose their spot market.  They will be required to post available power on the Western Systems Power Pool board.  Hydroelectric facilities will continue to be exempted.  \n\nPrice Mitigation-  Expanded to be in place 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Applies to all sellers, including marketers and non-public utilities.  The plan retains a single market clearing price auction for the spot market, based on marginal cost bids. The proxy price formula is changed in several respects:\n\n\t1.\tGas price will be the average of the mid-point of the monthly bid week prices as reported in Gas Daily \t\tfor Malin, SoCal Gas Large Packages and PG&E City Gate.\n\t2.\tO&M increases from $2 to $6.\n\t3.\tFuel start-up and emissions costs are eliminated from the formula and uplifted from the ISO (i.e. these \t\tcosts will be recovered from the ISO, but will not go into setting the proxy price).\n\t4.\tSimilarly, a credit adder of 10% will apply, only in CA. \n\nA reserve deficiency in CA (7% or less) also triggers mitigation for the rest of the WSCC.  The applicable price during reserve deficiency periods is the proxy price outlined above.  During times when no reserve deficiency exists, the mitigated price will be 85% of the highest price calculated in the last Stage 1 emergency.  This price will be in effect until the next Stage 1 emergency.  Sellers can bid higher than the proxy, with justification, during periods of reserve deficiency or when no reserve deficiency exists; PROVIDED THAT MARKETERS MAY NOT BID ABOVE THE PROXY PRICE.  FERC will consider the entire portfolio of a seller who seeks to justify a higher price than the proxy.  Generators may seek cost based rates for their entire portfolio in CA if they so choose (i.e. no cherry picking).\n\nDemand Side Management- The plan originally set forth in the April 26 order is expected be removed in this order. \n\nISO Reporting- ISO will need to report on a quarterly basis as to the status of building supply in CA. \n\nComments- Comments will be sought on the issue of whether the price mitigation formula should be adjusted in response to expected varying load conditions due to seasonal changes.\n\nSettlement Conference-  The settlement judge will convene a settlement conference on the refund issue no later than June 25 (next Monday) and the parties will have 15 days to settle.  A report from the judge to the Commission is due 7 days thereafter (for a total of 22 days).\n\nIssues that are NOT expected to be addressed in the order include confidentiality, ISO board issues, ISO scheduling penalty application, and market based rate authorization.  The Order is not finally issued as of yet, and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of a Final Order.  We will keep you posted.\n\nRay Alvarez\n","content":"\nThe following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission meeting held yesterday and additional intelligence gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting.

In order to avoid futu=\r\nre blackouts, Governor Gray Davis is waiving limits on hours of operation a=\r\nnd the associated emissions for natural gas-fired peaker units if they adhe=\r\nre to certain conditions.  He is requesting local air districts to allow na=\r\ntural gas-fired peaker power plants to operate in excess of their hourly, d=\r\naily, quarterly and/or annual emission limitations if they do the following=\r\n:\r\n\r\n1.=09Agree to sell power to the California Department of Water Resources or=\r\n to a utility located in California=20\r\n2.=09To serve an operating utility's own load\r\n3.=09Agree to sell to another California-based utility\r\n\r\nThe gas-fired peaker units must also pay a mitigation fee to the local air =\r\ndistricts of $7.50 per pound of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and $1.10 per poun=\r\nd of carbon monoxide (CO) emitted.  (The Governor set this number - it is, =\r\nhowever, the same amount the South Coast AQMD is charging for NOx offsets i=\r\nn the modifications it made to the RECLAIM program.) These mitigation fees =\r\nwill be used to clean up or retire other sources of pollution in the same a=\r\nir basin.  The Governor is ordering the California Air Resources Board to w=\r\nork with the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that power plants wi=\r\nlling to operate under this order obtain the necessary approvals.\r\n\r\nAs you know, there are many peaking plants that are close to exhausting the=\r\nir allowable operating hours.  Once these facilities exhaust the amount of =\r\nallowable hours they would have to either shut down the units or negotiate =\r\nan agreement with the local air agency to continue to operate.  With the ex=\r\nception of Mirant Potrero in San Francisco and Reliant Energy Mandalay in V=\r\nentura County, no facilities have negotiated such agreements.  The EO issue=\r\nd by the Governor gives the peaker facilities a blanket approval to operate=\r\n beyond the restrictions.  The Governor believes that waiving of the requir=\r\nements will also minimize reliance on backup diesel-fired generators, which=\r\n have even higher emissions than the natural gas peakers.  In my previous d=\r\niscussions with the US EPA Region 9, they did say they were willing to work=\r\n with the state to provide variances to power plants' operating limits.  Ho=\r\nwever,  in the two instances mentioned above, the EPA required the plants t=\r\no agree to install pollution control equipment at a specific future date.  =\r\nThis aspect of the agreement was critical to EPA, because the increased emi=\r\nssions from the peakers with increased hours are now significant enough (ma=\r\njor source status) to trigger New Source Review which requires installation=\r\n of Best Available Control Technology (BACT).  The EO by the Governor makes=\r\n no mention of future controls.\r\n\r\nAccording to municipal utilities and other generators, the Governor's actio=\r\nn could provide up to 1,200 Megawatts of additional power this summer by ex=\r\npanding the number of hours of operation at natural gas-fired plants.   The=\r\n EO will expire on October 31, 2001, unless revoked, modified or extended b=\r\ny further executive order.  The air director of the Ventura air board has a=\r\nlready sent comments opposing this order due to its negative air impacts.  =\r\nEnvironmentalists will also no doubt object.  The EPA has not yet responded=\r\n.  Despite the potential negative environmental effects, the political pres=\r\nsure will be strong to let these plants operate.

Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits =\r\non heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this su=\r\nmmer as long as the electricity they produce is sold in the state.=20\r\n     State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blac=\r\nkouts.=20\r\n     Davis' executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollu=\r\ntion fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natura=\r\nl gas-fired power plants, said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air =\r\nResources Board.=20\r\n     Municipal utility districts--including the Los Angeles Department of W=\r\nater and Power--and independent power companies could supply as much as 1,2=\r\n00 megawatts from so-called peaker plants, facilities that generally are pe=\r\nrmitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollute=\r\n so heavily. That is enough power for more than 1 million homes.=20\r\n     Other gas-fired power plants that have been shut down because of air p=\r\nollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order.=20\r\n     In a news conference Monday, state officials said the order will have =\r\nthe effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier die=\r\nsel generators, which industry could use if power supplies are threatened.=\r\n=20\r\n     \"If we don't get every last megawatt we can [from natural gas-fired pl=\r\nants],\" said Witherspoon of the air board, \"we will see people turning to d=\r\niesel more frequently.\"=20\r\n     Added Kellan Fluckiger, a top energy advisor to Davis: \"If you don't r=\r\nun these, you're either going to have outages or you're going to run someth=\r\ning dirtier.\"=20\r\n     Fluckiger said the order expands \"the number of hours these things can=\r\n run and the amount of energy they can produce.\"=20\r\n     New natural gas-fired power plants emit about half a pound per megawat=\r\nt-hour of operation of ozone-producing pollutants. The plants affected by t=\r\nhe order emit between two and five pounds of oxides of nitrogen per megawat=\r\nt-hour.=20\r\n     If the plants are pressed into operation for 200,000 megawatt-hours th=\r\nis summer, there will be between 400,000 and 1 million additional pounds of=\r\n oxides of nitrogen emitted into the air.=20\r\n     The state probably will end up paying the fees associated with the ext=\r\nra pollution through higher electricity prices. The fees amount to $7.50 pe=\r\nr pound of oxides of nitrogen--or $7.5 million if the plants operate for 20=\r\n0,000 hours--and $1.10 per pound of carbon monoxide emissions. The money wo=\r\nuld be used to reduce air pollution from other sources.=20\r\n     \"Under this order, dirty power plants can run as long as they want and=\r\n pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund,\" said Gail R=\r\nuderman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. =\r\n\"Our concern is that there's no guarantee that the fund will result in emis=\r\nsion reductions any time soon.\"=20\r\n     A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one =\r\npeaking power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivale=\r\nnt of adding 20,000 new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour. Relian=\r\nt Energy could not be reached for comment Monday night.=20\r\n     \"To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency, it's go=\r\ning to put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and it's going to m=\r\nake our air dirtier,\" said Dick Baldwin, air pollution control officer for =\r\nVentura County.=20\r\n     Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order, saying it was n=\r\needed so the city can sell the state as much as 1,000 megawatts of power th=\r\nis summer.=20\r\n     \"This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of=\r\n our excess capacity to the state,\" Wiggs said.=20\r\n     He added, however, that the city and state have not yet agreed on a pr=\r\nice for the power. Wiggs said the city is \"negotiating to get our cost as l=\r\now as we can legally charge\" so that customers of the city utility district=\r\n are not subsidizing consumers in the rest of the state. Municipal utility =\r\ndistricts elsewhere in the state also are expected to benefit from the orde=\r\nr.=20\r\n     Though the order was aimed at spurring municipal utilities to sell pow=\r\ner to the state, it also applies to independent power producers such as Rel=\r\niant Energy of Houston and Duke of North Carolina--both of which have calle=\r\nd on Davis to ease air pollution restrictions on their old natural gas-fire=\r\nd facilities.=20\r\n     \"This puts more money in the Texans' pockets and more air pollution in=\r\n Ventura County residents' lungs,\" said Baldwin of Ventura County.=20\r\n     Doug Allard, a Santa Barbara County air pollution control officer, als=\r\no said it seems as if the governor is giving private power generators much =\r\nof what they had sought.=20\r\n     \"We have serious concerns about the order,\" said Feuer of the Natural =\r\nResources Defense Council. \"It's taking the discretion away from local air =\r\ndistricts to regulate power plants in their region.\"=20\r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n     Times staff writer Nancy Vogel contributed to this story.=20\r\n     RELATED STORY=20\r\n     Utility: Edison plans to raise $1 billion in debt restructuring.

The plants affected by t=\r\nhe order emit between two and five pounds of oxides of nitrogen per megawat=\r\nt-hour.=20\r\n     If the plants are pressed into operation for 200,000 megawatt-hours th=\r\nis summer, there will be between 400,000 and 1 million additional pounds of=\r\n oxides of nitrogen emitted into the air.=20\r\n     The state probably will end up paying the fees associated with the ext=\r\nra pollution through higher electricity prices. The fees amount to $7.50 pe=\r\nr pound of oxides of nitrogen--or $7.5 million if the plants operate for 20=\r\n0,000 hours--and $1.10 per pound of carbon monoxide emissions. The money wo=\r\nuld be used to reduce air pollution from other sources.=20\r\n     \"Under this order, dirty power plants can run as long as they want and=\r\n pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund,\" said Gail R=\r\nuderman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. =\r\n\"Our concern is that there's no guarantee that the fund will result in emis=\r\nsion reductions any time soon.\"=20\r\n     A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one =\r\npeaking power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivale=\r\nnt of adding 20,000 new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour. Relian=\r\nt Energy could not be reached for comment Monday night.=20\r\n     \"To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency, it's go=\r\ning to put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and it's going to m=\r\nake our air dirtier,\" said Dick Baldwin, air pollution control officer for =\r\nVentura County.=20\r\n     Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order, saying it was n=\r\needed so the city can sell the state as much as 1,000 megawatts of power th=\r\nis summer.=20\r\n     \"This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of=\r\n our excess capacity to the state,\" Wiggs said.=20\r\n     He added, however, that the city and state have not yet agreed on a pr=\r\nice for the power. Wiggs said the city is \"negotiating to get our cost as l=\r\now as we can legally charge\" so that customers of the city utility district=\r\n are not subsidizing consumers in the rest of the state. Municipal utility =\r\ndistricts elsewhere in the state also are expected to benefit from the orde=\r\nr.=20\r\n     Though the order was aimed at spurring municipal utilities to sell pow=\r\ner to the state, it also applies to independent power producers such as Rel=\r\niant Energy of Houston and Duke of North Carolina--both of which have calle=\r\nd on Davis to ease air pollution restrictions on their old natural gas-fire=\r\nd facilities.=20\r\n     \"This puts more money in the Texans' pockets and more air pollution in=\r\n Ventura County residents' lungs,\" said Baldwin of Ventura County.=20\r\n     Doug Allard, a Santa Barbara County air pollution control officer, als=\r\no said it seems as if the governor is giving private power generators much =\r\nof what they had sought.=20\r\n     \"We have serious concerns about the order,\" said Feuer of the Natural =\r\nResources Defense Council. \"It's taking the discretion away from local air =\r\ndistricts to regulate power plants in their region.\"=20\r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n     Times staff writer Nancy Vogel contributed to this story.=20\r\n     RELATED STORY=20\r\n     Utility: Edison plans to raise $1 billion in debt restructuring.

This action=\r\n comes only a day before FERC and other witnesses will  testify on the Fein=\r\nstein/Smith price cap legislation before the Senate Energy Committee, Gov. =\r\nDavis and FERC will  testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committ=\r\nee on Wednesday, and the House Financial Services Committee joins the fray =\r\nwith a hearing on the California energy situation on Wednesday.  The latter=\r\n committee will probably base its jurisdiction over some aspect of energy p=\r\nolicy on a number of factors, including its jurisdiction over presidential =\r\neconomic emergency powers.  The committee staff has in the past expressed i=\r\nnterest in derivatives and other financial aspects of energy trading and ma=\r\nrkets.

The FERC also denied the Attorney General's motion to intervene -- this is important because only intervenors can appeal the decision to the courts.\n\nSue Mara\nEnron Corp.\nTel: (415) 782-7802\nFax:(415) 782-7854\n----- Forwarded by Susan J Mara/NA/Enron on 06/14/2001 11:24 AM -----\n\n\n\t\"Jackie Gallagher\" <JGallagher@epsa.org> 06/14/2001 07:46 AM \t   To: <acomnes@enron.com>, <bernadette.hawkins@enron.com>, <carin.nersesian@enron.com>, <Christi.L.Nicolay@enron.com>, <donna.fulton@enron.com>, <janelle.scheuer@enron.com>, <jhartso@enron.com>, <john.shelk@enron.com>, <jsteffe@enron.com>, <linda.j.noske@enron.com>, <linda.robertson@enron.com>, <Ray.Alvarez@enron.com>, <richard.shapiro@enron.com>, <sarah.novosel@enron.com>, <SScott3@enron.com>, <Susan.J.Mara@enron.com>, <tom.hoatson@enron.com>  cc:   Subject: Order Denying Rehearing on Creditworthiness\t\n\n\n\n\n\n - ER01-889-004.PDF ","messageId":"<13043068.1075840020323.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-06-15T02:59:04+05:30","from":"susan.mara@enron.com","subject":"Order Denying Rehearing on Creditworthiness","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Mara, Susan </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=8A20ECE9-992CF340-8625697D-7146E9>","xTo":"Comnes, Alan </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=ACOMNES>, Benevides, Dennis </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=F380D26C-F74D47D4-862564DE-65EE01>, Bresnan, Neil </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=DC75CF5A-EBD2BACF-862566C5-6B3C9B>, Black, Don </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=3FB677C9-5533A11E-8625699D-71B01E>, Foster, Chris H. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=CFOSTER>, Whalan, Jubran </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=1C21E1A5-A799714F-862564C8-6C925D>, rcarroll@bracepatt.com, Hall, Steve C. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SHALL4>, gfergus@brobeck.com, Alonso, Tom </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=TALONSO>, Alvarez, Ray </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=EBE4476B-2D94882A-86256A14-75FF3B>, Badeer, Robert </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=RBADEER>, Belden, Tim </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=TBELDEN>, Crandall, Sean </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SCRANDA>, Driscoll, Michael M. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MDRISC3>, Fisher, Mark </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=BE89ED9D-41D8378D-862569D8-80D1CA>, Guzman, Mark </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MGUZMAN3>, Heizenrader, Timothy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=THEIZEN>, Mallory, Chris </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=CMALLOR>, Motley, Matt </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MMOTLEY>, Platter, Phillip </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=PPLATTE>, Richter, Jeff </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JRICHTE>, Scholtes, Diana </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DSCHOLT>, Swain, Steve </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SSWAIN>, Swerzbin, Mike </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MSWERZB>, Williams III, Bill </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=BWILLIA5>, Nicolay, Christi </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=5836B2AD-ED2E830F-86256502-7152CC>, Steffes, James </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=AFB3D0FA-CCB03D20-86256962-56FDA5>, Perrino, Dave </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=13E30736-7885E1B0-86256A31-56095B>, Walton, Steve </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=B307C856-48FAA49D-86256721-510ADA>, Yoder, Christian </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=CYODER>, Tribolet, Michael </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MTRIBOLE>","xFolder":"\\ExMerge - Scholtes, Diana\\FERC","xOrigin":"SCHOLTES-D","to":"alan.comnes@enron.com,dennis.benevides@enron.com,neil.bresnan@enron.com,don.black@enron.com,h..foster@enron.com,jubran.whalan@enron.com,ray.alvarez@enron.com,robert.badeer@enron.com,tim.belden@enron.com,sean.crandall@enron.com,m..driscoll@enron.com,mark.fisher@enron.com,mark.guzman@enron.com,timothy.heizenrader@enron.com,chris.mallory@enron.com,matt.motley@enron.com,phillip.platter@enron.com,jeff.richter@enron.com,diana.scholtes@enron.com,steve.swain@enron.com,mike.swerzbin@enron.com,bill.williams@enron.com,christi.nicolay@enron.com,james.steffes@enron.com,dave.perrino@enron.com,steve.walton@enron.com,christian.yoder@enron.com,michael.tribolet@enron.com"}

It could provide some indication of the direction FERC will take with the order it plans to issue next Monday.  Summarizing, the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire WSCC, which plan should:\n\nprohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements; refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan\n\nadopt market mechanisms (rather than imposing rigid price controls) and allow recovery of all verifiable costs\n\npromote conservation and demand response \n\nPlease see details below.\n\n\n\n\nJune 12, 2001\nThe Honorable Curt H\n\n?bert, Jr.\nChairman\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission\n888 First Street, NE\nWashington DC, 20426\n\nDear Chairman H?bert:\n\nSince last summer, the Committee on Energy and Commerce has closely\nmonitored the electricity situation in California.  Today, the West\ncontinues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century, and\nCalifornia faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again\nthis summer.  After extensive review of the energy crisis in the West,\nincluding several hearings in Washington and California, we recommend that\nthe Commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity\nprices and keep power flowing into California.\n\nWe recognize the Commission's efforts in recent months to address the\nelectricity crisis in the California and western markets, including measures\nto investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices.  While we are\npleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout\nthe West, we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale\nelectricity prices on consumers and economic growth in California and the\nentire West in the hot summer months to come.  To ensure that prices are\njust and reasonable during the critical months ahead, we believe the\nCommission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices\nin western markets.  We strongly urge the Commission to implement a\ncomprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor\nwholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market\nparticipants within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC).\n\nSpecifically, such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale\nelectricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the\nWSCC.  The plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and\nfailures to comply with agreements to sell power.  If the Commission finds\nthat a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan, it\nshould strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the\nfull extent allowed by law.\n\nAware of the danger of discouraging supply, the Commission has relied upon\nmarket-oriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would\nexacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts.  We share\nthe Commission's concerns regarding the need to encourage supply.\nAccordingly, to prevent blackouts and contribute to a long-term solution,\nthe Commission's comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as\nappropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging\navailability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission.\n\nTo mitigate prices and increase available supply, we also urge the\nCommission to take every additional step within its authority to promote\nconservation and demand response throughout the western market.  In States\nwhere retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs, consumers have less\nincentive to conserve.  While demand reduction incentives are not a\nsubstitute for accurate price signals, a demand response program can\nencourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity.\nSuch a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both\nwholesale and retail consumers to sell, at market or other incentive prices,\n\"foregone\" electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume.\nSpecifically, the Commission should: (1) establish or certify a wholesale\n\"clearinghouse\" for demand reduction agreements; and (2) enable consumers,\nwhether individually or through aggregation arrangements, to sell foregone\npower to their own local distribution utility or to third-party purchasers.\nWe recognize that individual States and utilities are implementing demand\nreduction programs, but a broader, regional solution is needed to enable\nsufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer.  We\nunderstand that such a program can be implemented without preempting State\nlaws, abrogating existing contracts, or shifting costs to non-participant\nconsumers.\n\nWe look forward to working with you to build upon the Commission's previous\nefforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for\nconsumers in California and the West this summer and thereafter.  To ensure\nmaximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead, we request that you\ntake appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as\npossible.  We request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not\nlater than the close of business on Friday, June 22.  If you have questions\nplease contact our staff.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation with\nthis request.\n\nSincerely,\nW.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin\n\nChairman\n\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\n\nJoe Barton\nChairman\nSubcommittee on Energy and Air Quality\n\nHeather Wilson\n\nMember\n\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\n\nGeorge Radanovich\nMember\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\n\n\nMary Bono\n\nMember\n\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\n\nGreg Walden\nMember\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\n\n\nWilliam M.

If the Commission finds\nthat a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan, it\nshould strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the\nfull extent allowed by law.\n\nAware of the danger of discouraging supply, the Commission has relied upon\nmarket-oriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would\nexacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts.  We share\nthe Commission's concerns regarding the need to encourage supply.\nAccordingly, to prevent blackouts and contribute to a long-term solution,\nthe Commission's comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as\nappropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging\navailability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission.\n\nTo mitigate prices and increase available supply, we also urge the\nCommission to take every additional step within its authority to promote\nconservation and demand response throughout the western market.  In States\nwhere retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs, consumers have less\nincentive to conserve.  While demand reduction incentives are not a\nsubstitute for accurate price signals, a demand response program can\nencourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity.\nSuch a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both\nwholesale and retail consumers to sell, at market or other incentive prices,\n\"foregone\" electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume.\nSpecifically, the Commission should: (1) establish or certify a wholesale\n\"clearinghouse\" for demand reduction agreements; and (2) enable consumers,\nwhether individually or through aggregation arrangements, to sell foregone\npower to their own local distribution utility or to third-party purchasers.\nWe recognize that individual States and utilities are implementing demand\nreduction programs, but a broader, regional solution is needed to enable\nsufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer.  We\nunderstand that such a program can be implemented without preempting State\nlaws, abrogating existing contracts, or shifting costs to non-participant\nconsumers.\n\nWe look forward to working with you to build upon the Commission's previous\nefforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for\nconsumers in California and the West this summer and thereafter.  To ensure\nmaximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead, we request that you\ntake appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as\npossible.  We request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not\nlater than the close of business on Friday, June 22.  If you have questions\nplease contact our staff.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation with\nthis request.\n\nSincerely,\nW.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin\n\nChairman\n\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\n\nJoe Barton\nChairman\nSubcommittee on Energy and Air Quality\n\nHeather Wilson\n\nMember\n\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\n\nGeorge Radanovich\nMember\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\n\n\nMary Bono\n\nMember\n\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\n\nGreg Walden\nMember\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\n\n\nWilliam M.

{"rawContent":"\n\n \nTuesday, June 12, 2001 \nDavis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules \n Electricity: Order will allow more production from heavily polluting 'peaker' facilities. \n\n\nBy DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer\n\n\n\n\n\n     SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits on heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this summer as long as the electricity they produce is sold in the state. \n     State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blackouts. \n     Davis' executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollution fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natural gas-fired power plants, said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air Resources Board. \n     Municipal utility districts--including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power--and independent power companies could supply as much as 1,200 megawatts from so-called peaker plants, facilities that generally are permitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollute so heavily. That is enough power for more than 1 million homes. \n     Other gas-fired power plants that have been shut down because of air pollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order. \n     In a news conference Monday, state officials said the order will have the effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier diesel generators, which industry could use if power supplies are threatened. \n     \"If we don't get every last megawatt we can [from natural gas-fired plants],\" said Witherspoon of the air board, \"we will see people turning to diesel more frequently.\" \n     Added Kellan Fluckiger, a top energy advisor to Davis: \"If you don't run these, you're either going to have outages or you're going to run something dirtier.\" \n     Fluckiger said the order expands \"the number of hours these things can run and the amount of energy they can produce.\" \n     New natural gas-fired power plants emit about half a pound per megawatt-hour of operation of ozone-producing pollutants. The plants affected by the order emit between two and five pounds of oxides of nitrogen per megawatt-hour. \n     If the plants are pressed into operation for 200,000 megawatt-hours this summer, there will be between 400,000 and 1 million additional pounds of oxides of nitrogen emitted into the air. \n     The state probably will end up paying the fees associated with the extra pollution through higher electricity prices. The fees amount to $7.50 per pound of oxides of nitrogen--or $7.5 million if the plants operate for 200,000 hours--and $1.10 per pound of carbon monoxide emissions. The money would be used to reduce air pollution from other sources. \n     \"Under this order, dirty power plants can run as long as they want and pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund,\" said Gail Ruderman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"Our concern is that there's no guarantee that the fund will result in emission reductions any time soon.\" \n     A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one peaking power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivalent of adding 20,000 new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour. Reliant Energy could not be reached for comment Monday night. \n     \"To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency, it's going to put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and it's going to make our air dirtier,\" said Dick Baldwin, air pollution control officer for Ventura County. \n     Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order, saying it was needed so the city can sell the state as much as 1,000 megawatts of power this summer. \n     \"This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our excess capacity to the state,\" Wiggs said. \n     He added, however, that the city and state have not yet agreed on a price for the power. Wiggs said the city is \"negotiating to get our cost as low as we can legally charge\" so that customers of the city utility district are not subsidizing consumers in the rest of the state. Municipal utility districts elsewhere in the state also are expected to benefit from the order. \n     Though the order was aimed at spurring municipal utilities to sell power to the state, it also applies to independent power producers such as Reliant Energy of Houston and Duke of North Carolina--both of which have called on Davis to ease air pollution restrictions on their old natural gas-fired facilities. \n     \"This puts more money in the Texans' pockets and more air pollution in Ventura County residents' lungs,\" said Baldwin of Ventura County. \n     Doug Allard, a Santa Barbara County air pollution control officer, also said it seems as if the governor is giving private power generators much of what they had sought. \n     \"We have serious concerns about the order,\" said Feuer of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"It's taking the discretion away from local air districts to regulate power plants in their region.\" \n\n\n* * *\n     Times staff writer Nancy Vogel contributed to this story. \n     RELATED STORY \n     Utility: Edison plans to raise $1 billion in debt restructuring.

{"rawContent":"\nLate in the afternoon on Friday May 25, FERC issued an order providing clarification and preliminary guidance on implementation of the mitigation and monitoring plan for the California wholesale electric markets that it adopted on April 26. The order is limited to clarifying four critical issues prior to the Mitigation Plan's May 29 (today) effective date: (1) treatment of generators who did not supply heat and emission rates; (2) calculation of a natural gas proxy price; (3) price mitigation in the ISO's spot markets other than Imbalance Energy; and (4) creditworthiness.  The order does not resolve the rehearing requests, nor does it accept or reject the ISO's proposed tariff amendments for filing.  These pleadings are still under review and FERC will address them in a separate order.  \n\nTreatment of Generators Who Did Not Supply Heat and Emission Rates\n\nFERC accepts the ISO's proposal for generating units within California (including non-public utility generating units) that have not supplied heat and emission rates in compliance with the April 26 Order:\n\nFor the generating units that have not provided the requisite data or whose data the ISO believes to be inadequate, the ISO will use data from a viable alternative source (e.g., either current or pre-existing Reliability Must-Run Contracts).  If an alternative source of data does not exist and the generating unit continues to refuse to supply the requisite information, the ISO will treat the non-compliant generators as price-takers, i.e., the ISO will assume a $0/MWh bid for all available capacity from these units.  These generators, if dispatched, will be paid the market clearing price.  \n\nThe FERC finds that to the extent a non-compliant seller does not wish to be treated as a price-taker, the ISO's approach will provide such entities with an incentive to provide the ISO and the Commission with the requisite data.\n\nCalculation of a Natural Gas Proxy Price\n\nFERC rejects the ISO proposal to calculate a proxy natural gas cost based upon the simple average of Gas Daily index prices for Malin, PG&E CityGate, and Southern California Border (Kern River Station).  The ISO is directed to calculate the natural gas proxy price using the published daily prices for Malin, PG&E CityGate, Southern California Border (Kern River Station), SoCalGas large packages, and PG&E large packages.  The Commission will consider whether any changes should be made to the California delivery points during rehearing of the April 26 Order.      \n\nPrice Mitigation in the ISO's Spot Markets other than Imbalance Energy\n\nThe FERC finds that the ISO erred in its interpretation- that it does not intend to apply any price mitigation to its Ancillary Services spot markets or Adjustment Bids. The April 26 Order did not explicitly address the issue of price mitigation in any market other than that for Imbalance Energy, the order nonetheless noted that \"this proceeding was established . . . to address whether a price mitigation plan was needed to replace the $150/MWh breakpoint methodology.\"  The $150/MWh breakpoint methodology applied to the ISO's Ancillary Services markets.  Therefore, the ISO must replace the $150/MWh breakpoint methodology in those markets with the superseding methodology adopted in the April 26 Order.  The Commission further clarifies that the April 26 Order did not replace the ISO's current methodology for mitigating Adjustment Bid prices.\n\nWith respect to calculating the market clearing price for Ancillary Services, FERC directs the ISO to use each relevant average hourly mitigated Imbalance Energy price.  If the Ancillary Services markets clear below the average hourly mitigated Imbalance Energy price for that hour, then the ISO will pay the Ancillary Services clearing price for that market.  If the Ancillary Services markets clear above the average hourly mitigated Imbalance Energy price, then the ISO will use that price to clear the market and will pay as-bid for all Ancillary Services that are needed above the mitigated price.  Bids accepted above the mitigated price will be subject to refund and justification.  \n\nCreditworthiness\n\nAs of May 29, 2001, FERC expects the ISO to ensure the presence of a creditworthy buyer for all transactions made with all generators who offer power in compliance with the must-offer requirement in the Mitigation Plan. \n\n\n - EL00-95.1.WPD \n\n","content":"\nLate in the afternoon on Friday May 25, FERC issued an order providing clarification and preliminary guidance on implementation of the mitigation and monitoring plan for the California wholesale electric markets that it adopted on April 26.

A \nmegawatt is enough power for about 750 homes. \nJoel Bluestein\nEnergy and Environmental Analysis, Inc.\nPhone 703-528-1900\nFax 703-528-5106\n\n\n\n\n<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>","messageId":"<31147154.1075840020869.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-05-26T00:27:19+05:30","from":"alan.comnes@enron.com","subject":"FW: CA Power/Environmnet","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Comnes, Alan </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=ACOMNES>","xTo":"Alonso, Tom </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Talonso>, Alvarez, Ray </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=ebe4476b-2d94882a-86256a14-75ff3b>, Badeer, Robert </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbadeer>, Belden, Tim </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tbelden>, Crandall, Sean </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Scranda>, Driscoll, Michael M. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mdrisc3>, Fisher, Mark </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=be89ed9d-41d8378d-862569d8-80d1ca>, Foster, Chris H. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cfoster>, Guzman, Mark </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mguzman3>, Heizenrader, Timothy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Theizen>, Mallory, Chris </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cmallor>, Mara, Susan </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=8a20ece9-992cf340-8625697d-7146e9>, Motley, Matt </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mmotley>, Perrino, Dave </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=13e30736-7885e1b0-86256a31-56095b>, Platter, Phillip </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pplatte>, Richter, Jeff </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jrichte>, Scholtes, Diana </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dscholt>, Swain, Steve </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sswain>, Swerzbin, Mike </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mswerzb>, Williams III, Bill </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bwillia5>, Wolfe, Greg </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gwolfe>","xFolder":"\\ExMerge - Scholtes, Diana\\FERC","xOrigin":"SCHOLTES-D","to":"tom.alonso@enron.com,ray.alvarez@enron.com,robert.badeer@enron.com,tim.belden@enron.com,sean.crandall@enron.com,m..driscoll@enron.com,mark.fisher@enron.com,h..foster@enron.com,mark.guzman@enron.com,timothy.heizenrader@enron.com,chris.mallory@enron.com,susan.mara@enron.com,matt.motley@enron.com,dave.perrino@enron.com,phillip.platter@enron.com,jeff.richter@enron.com,diana.scholtes@enron.com,steve.swain@enron.com,mike.swerzbin@enron.com,bill.williams@enron.com,greg.wolfe@enron.com"}

There had been a=\r\nn effort to include an RTG provision in the bill, but it died when the conf=\r\nerence committee was finalizing the bill.  There was a view by many in the =\r\nWest at the time, that it would still be better to move ahead with self-imp=\r\nlementation of open access rather than waiting for litigation.  In the summ=\r\ner of 1994, first WRTA (Western Regional Transmission Assocation) then SWRT=\r\nA (Southwestern Regional Transmission Association) and NRTA (Northwest Regi=\r\nonal Transmission Association) were filed.  They were developed in an open =\r\nprocess that included, perhaps for the first time, the transmission owners,=\r\n the transmission dependent utilities, new market entrants and state regula=\r\ntors.  The IPPs and Marketers were participants, including Enron, Electric =\r\nClearing House (now Dynegy), DesTec, CalPine, Tenaska, etc.  FERC responded=\r\n in November telling WRTA that it would have to accept comparable transmiss=\r\nion access.  Instead of collapsing as predicted by the \"just say no\" crowd,=\r\n the members accepted the conditions and accepted those conditions.  WRTA f=\r\normed in June of 1995. =20\r\n=20\r\nWhile the RTGs appear rather tame today, at the time they challenged the tr=\r\naditional view, offering to provide open access tariffs.  When the FERC iss=\r\nued the NOPR that gave us Orders 888/889 just prior to WRTAs formation, the=\r\n participants in the three Western RTGs members responded during the summer=\r\n of 1995 by working together to develop the key concepts of what became OAS=\r\nIS.  With the filing of the current OATTs, much of the ground breaking work=\r\n of the RTGs was done, but they remained a forum for discussion of the inte=\r\nrface between commercial and reliablity.  A common planning data base was d=\r\neveloped in which included non-traditional participants and their ideas to =\r\nbe included.  The Western Market Interface Committee (WMIC) was organized b=\r\ny the RTGs and has had a continuing role in bringing the the three (soon to=\r\n be two?) RTOs proposals together.\r\n=20\r\nWhen the Western RTGs were organized in 1995 they were formed outside of WS=\r\nCC.  WSCC had a very restrictive policy, allowing only utilities to be memb=\r\ners.  When they grudgingly allowed IPPs to join, it was still by half-measu=\r\nres.  For instance, WSCC would allow only employees of the member to attend=\r\n, so new, small members could not employ a consultant for joint representat=\r\nion.  When the RTG discussions were underway, the good old boys wanted it i=\r\nnside WSCC with the same kinds of restrictions.  We broke that mold, formed=\r\n separately and then through the FERC order approving WRTA force WSCC to op=\r\nen its membership fully or to face the creating of a separate planning orga=\r\nnization.  The change passed by one vote, but the change occured.\r\n=20\r\nOnce all the organizations were up and running (WSCC, WRTA, NRTA, SWRTA) it=\r\n was obvious that there was substantial duplication of meetings and functio=\r\nns.   Serions talks of a merger began in about 1998.  They went very slowly=\r\n, but finally produced a common organization to be called the Western Elect=\r\nric Coordinating Council (WECC), which would merge WSCC, WRTA and SWRTA tog=\r\nether initially.  NRTA will likely vote to merge as well.  WECC is a RRG as=\r\n far as NERC is concerned. =20\r\n=20\r\nWhile the new bylaws do not go as far as I would have liked, they do furthe=\r\nr open up the WSCC process and provide for some consideration of the commer=\r\ncial impact of reliablity rules.  Is this a transitional phase? Perhaps.  D=\r\noes it go as far as the EISB proposal?  No, but I see no reason to play \"sm=\r\nash-em, bash-em\" will every effort that hasn't followed the latest turn in =\r\nour thinking.  As I hope this memo shows, we have been evolving the industr=\r\ny, never as fast as Enron or others (myself included) have wanted it to cha=\r\nnge.  The WECC will reconsititue the WSCC board under new membership rules =\r\nand opens the possiblity of changing the entrenched senior staff as WSCC to=\r\n breath some life into the organization.  At a minimum, the change from WSC=\r\nC/WRTA/SWRTA/NRTA to WECC will provide interim improvement while the debate=\r\n over EISB works its way to a conclusion and further change takes place.\r\n=20\r\nSteve\r\n=20\r\n-----Original Message-----=20\r\nFrom: Yeung, Charles=20\r\nSent: Fri 9/28/2001 8:26 AM=20\r\nTo: Shelk, John; Novosel, Sarah=20\r\nCc: Robertson, Linda; Nersesian, Carin; Walton, Steve; Perrino, Dave; Rodri=\r\nquez, Andy=20\r\nSubject: RE: WECC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first I have heard of WECC.  I assume it is a \"Western\" NERC -t=\r\nype organization?=20\r\n\r\n I understand that the traders in the West are not too concerned about form=\r\ning single standards applicable to both the East and West.  They would howe=\r\nver, like to see more consistency in practices between TPs within the West =\r\nitself.  Sounds like WECC may be able to do this. One of the big problems w=\r\nith the WSCC has been that it was not as stringent in dictating operating r=\r\nequirements on its members as the East has tried to be.   At NERC, WSCC mem=\r\nbers have always argued deference to the West due to system differences.  U=\r\nnfortunately deference to the West has meant little to no standardization i=\r\nn the West over many transmission access practices, leaving it up to the su=\r\nb-regions or individual TPs to decide.  I am not saying they are not techni=\r\ncally justified, but there has been no incentive to bring about more consis=\r\ntent practices.\r\n\r\nIs WECC consistent with EISB?  It depends, if WECC is sovereign over any ot=\r\nher organization for standards approval, then I would say no.  I think WECC=\r\n should be subject to the EISB process and have to get standards approved t=\r\nhrough EISB as well.

There had been a=\r\nn effort to include an RTG provision in the bill, but it died when the conf=\r\nerence committee was finalizing the bill.  There was a view by many in the =\r\nWest at the time, that it would still be better to move ahead with self-imp=\r\nlementation of open access rather than waiting for litigation.  In the summ=\r\ner of 1994, first WRTA (Western Regional Transmission Assocation) then SWRT=\r\nA (Southwestern Regional Transmission Association) and NRTA (Northwest Regi=\r\nonal Transmission Association) were filed.  They were developed in an open =\r\nprocess that included, perhaps for the first time, the transmission owners,=\r\n the transmission dependent utilities, new market entrants and state regula=\r\ntors.  The IPPs and Marketers were participants, including Enron, Electric =\r\nClearing House (now Dynegy), DesTec, CalPine, Tenaska, etc.  FERC responded=\r\n in November telling WRTA that it would have to accept comparable transmiss=\r\nion access.  Instead of collapsing as predicted by the \"just say no\" crowd,=\r\n the members accepted the conditions and accepted those conditions.  WRTA f=\r\normed in June of 1995. =20\r\n=20\r\nWhile the RTGs appear rather tame today, at the time they challenged the tr=\r\naditional view, offering to provide open access tariffs.  When the FERC iss=\r\nued the NOPR that gave us Orders 888/889 just prior to WRTAs formation, the=\r\n participants in the three Western RTGs members responded during the summer=\r\n of 1995 by working together to develop the key concepts of what became OAS=\r\nIS.  With the filing of the current OATTs, much of the ground breaking work=\r\n of the RTGs was done, but they remained a forum for discussion of the inte=\r\nrface between commercial and reliablity.  A common planning data base was d=\r\neveloped in which included non-traditional participants and their ideas to =\r\nbe included.  The Western Market Interface Committee (WMIC) was organized b=\r\ny the RTGs and has had a continuing role in bringing the the three (soon to=\r\n be two?) RTOs proposals together.\r\n=20\r\nWhen the Western RTGs were organized in 1995 they were formed outside of WS=\r\nCC.  WSCC had a very restrictive policy, allowing only utilities to be memb=\r\ners.  When they grudgingly allowed IPPs to join, it was still by half-measu=\r\nres.  For instance, WSCC would allow only employees of the member to attend=\r\n, so new, small members could not employ a consultant for joint representat=\r\nion.  When the RTG discussions were underway, the good old boys wanted it i=\r\nnside WSCC with the same kinds of restrictions.  We broke that mold, formed=\r\n separately and then through the FERC order approving WRTA force WSCC to op=\r\nen its membership fully or to face the creating of a separate planning orga=\r\nnization.  The change passed by one vote, but the change occured.\r\n=20\r\nOnce all the organizations were up and running (WSCC, WRTA, NRTA, SWRTA) it=\r\n was obvious that there was substantial duplication of meetings and functio=\r\nns.   Serions talks of a merger began in about 1998.  They went very slowly=\r\n, but finally produced a common organization to be called the Western Elect=\r\nric Coordinating Council (WECC), which would merge WSCC, WRTA and SWRTA tog=\r\nether initially.  NRTA will likely vote to merge as well.  WECC is a RRG as=\r\n far as NERC is concerned. =20\r\n=20\r\nWhile the new bylaws do not go as far as I would have liked, they do furthe=\r\nr open up the WSCC process and provide for some consideration of the commer=\r\ncial impact of reliablity rules.  Is this a transitional phase? Perhaps.  D=\r\noes it go as far as the EISB proposal?  No, but I see no reason to play \"sm=\r\nash-em, bash-em\" will every effort that hasn't followed the latest turn in =\r\nour thinking.  As I hope this memo shows, we have been evolving the industr=\r\ny, never as fast as Enron or others (myself included) have wanted it to cha=\r\nnge.  The WECC will reconsititue the WSCC board under new membership rules =\r\nand opens the possiblity of changing the entrenched senior staff as WSCC to=\r\n breath some life into the organization.  At a minimum, the change from WSC=\r\nC/WRTA/SWRTA/NRTA to WECC will provide interim improvement while the debate=\r\n over EISB works its way to a conclusion and further change takes place.\r\n=20\r\nSteve\r\n=20\r\n-----Original Message-----=20\r\nFrom: Yeung, Charles=20\r\nSent: Fri 9/28/2001 8:26 AM=20\r\nTo: Shelk, John; Novosel, Sarah=20\r\nCc: Robertson, Linda; Nersesian, Carin; Walton, Steve; Perrino, Dave; Rodri=\r\nquez, Andy=20\r\nSubject: RE: WECC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first I have heard of WECC.  I assume it is a \"Western\" NERC -t=\r\nype organization?=20\r\n\r\n I understand that the traders in the West are not too concerned about form=\r\ning single standards applicable to both the East and West.  They would howe=\r\nver, like to see more consistency in practices between TPs within the West =\r\nitself.  Sounds like WECC may be able to do this. One of the big problems w=\r\nith the WSCC has been that it was not as stringent in dictating operating r=\r\nequirements on its members as the East has tried to be.   At NERC, WSCC mem=\r\nbers have always argued deference to the West due to system differences.  U=\r\nnfortunately deference to the West has meant little to no standardization i=\r\nn the West over many transmission access practices, leaving it up to the su=\r\nb-regions or individual TPs to decide.  I am not saying they are not techni=\r\ncally justified, but there has been no incentive to bring about more consis=\r\ntent practices.\r\n\r\nIs WECC consistent with EISB?  It depends, if WECC is sovereign over any ot=\r\nher organization for standards approval, then I would say no.  I think WECC=\r\n should be subject to the EISB process and have to get standards approved t=\r\nhrough EISB as well.  The problem is that EISB is voluntary and if WECC can=\r\n go directly to FERC, then it becomes effectively the same as \"deference to=\r\n the West\" -type language we have been fighting against. =20\r\n\r\nSo my verdict on WECC depends.....=20\r\nAs I noted in an earlier note, I believe there are those pushing for NERC t=\r\no continue doing \"reliability-only\" and establish a contractual relationshi=\r\np to coordinate with EISB.

State officials say she is doing a good job. \n\n\nBy JEFFREY L. RABIN, DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writers\n\n\n\n\n\n     The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with barely a year's experience in the energy industry $240,000 annually to head a team of traders who secure California's daily electricity supply. \n     State officials hired Susan T. Lee, 30, in April without competitive bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov. Gray Davis. \n     Lee's contract is equal to the $20,000 a month that Davis pays his chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman, a top utility executive for decades. \n     The two-year contract will pay Lee up to $480,000 to oversee the state's day-to-day energy purchases, totaling billions of dollars a year. \n     Lee's contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nation's largest power buyers, a role that it took on in January as California's utilities faltered. \n     Lee's contract was one of about a dozen released Monday, and among the largest. \n     Reached at her Sacramento office, Lee would not discuss her contract. She said only that she heads a 15-person team of traders and schedulers that works long hours to keep California's power flowing. \n     Pete Garris, a contracts manager for the state Department of Water Resources who recruited Lee, said he met her at industry meetings and had been impressed by her savvy. \n     He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April after Ron Shimizu, her boss at Mieco Inc., a trading firm in Long Beach, recommended her. Shimizu refused comment Tuesday. \n     The state, according to Garris, must compete for employees against an aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game. \n     \"You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary,\" Garris said. \"Unless we can get permanent and full-time positions approved, these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire [consultants].\" \n     Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lee's contract with the six-month, $120,000 deal that Freeman--the former boss at several major utilities--struck with the governor. \n     \"I don't want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman,\" Garris said. \"David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan came from a [private] power marketer. With Susan, we just followed the standard formula.\" \n     In her new job, Lee will direct an immensely complicated, around-the-clock operation responsible for \"procuring energy, scheduling power and associated transmission, and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries,\" according to her contract. \n     Lee's resume, attached to the contract, shows that she had no experience in the energy field until March 2000, when she joined Mieco. There, she was a trader and power scheduler, not a manager. \n     \"She was only here for a year or so,\" said Dina Alvarez, an administrative manager for the company. \n     A 1994 graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics, she worked as a pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining Mieco. \n     Lee's contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week, not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field. \n     She is being paid $120 an hour and can earn a maximum of $480,000, including expenses, by April 2003. \n     Another new consultant, William L. Green, has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration, Pacific Gas & Electric and the California Independent System Operator. He is being paid $85 an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the state's accounting of energy purchases. His two-year deal is worth up to $340,000. \n     They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals. \n     Richard Ferreira, the former assistant general manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District, has a $500,000 contract and is being paid $200 an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts. He worked for the Department of Water Resources for 23 years before joining the Sacramento agency in 1987. \n     Hardy Energy Consulting also has a $150,000, six-month contract that calls for Randy Harvey to be paid $300 an hour. Harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience, particularly at the Bonneville Power Administration, where he was chief executive officer from 1991 to 1997. \n     Lee's recruiter, Garris, said her lack of experience is not a concern. \n     \"So far she's done an excellent job,\" he said. \"She has the skills, and she has the ability. She was doing a similar job.\" \n     Dozens of consultants, including Lee, have been hired since January, when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power. \n     The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric because they were no longer considered credit-worthy, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the Department of Water Resources. \n     Hidalgo said that about 60% of the 95 people now working for the division are consultants. The rest are state employees. \n     As part of the process, Lee's unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed. Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months. \nCopyright 2001 Los Angeles Times \n \n\n\n \n\n  \n \n ","content":"\n\"Randy Harvey\" is Randy Hardy.

Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months. \nCopyright 2001 Los Angeles Times \n \n\n\n \n\n  \n \n ","messageId":"<17736806.1075863608554.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-07-06T03:06:35+05:30","from":"c..hall@enron.com","subject":"RE: Energy Novice to Be Paid $240,000","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Hall, Steve C. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SHALL4>","xTo":"Comnes, Alan </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Acomnes>, Alonso, Tom </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Talonso>, Alvarez, Ray </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=ebe4476b-2d94882a-86256a14-75ff3b>, Badeer, Robert </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbadeer>, Belden, Tim </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tbelden>, Calger, Christopher F. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ccalger>, Choi, Paul </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pchoi>, Dasovich, Jeff </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=da220740-3e85e661-86256962-4f9c13>, Driscoll, Michael M. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mdrisc3>, Fischer, Mark </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mfische2>, Foster, Chris H. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cfoster>, Guzman, Mark </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mguzman3>, Heizenrader, Tim </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Theizen>, Kaufman, Paul </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pkaufma>, Krebs, Holli </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Hkrebs>, Mainzer, Elliot </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Emainze>, Mallory, Chris </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cmallor>, Malowney, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmalown>, Mara, Susan </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=8a20ece9-992cf340-8625697d-7146e9>, Motley, Matt </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mmotley>, Perrino, Dave </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=13e30736-7885e1b0-86256a31-56095b>, Platter, Phillip </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pplatte>, Richter, Jeff </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jrichte>, Rosman, Stewart </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Srosman>, Scholtes, Diana </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dscholt>, Stokley, Chris </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mstokle>, Swain, Steve </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sswain>, Swerzbin, Mike </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mswerzb>, Symes, Kate </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ksymes>, Williams III, Bill </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bwillia5>, Wolfe, Greg </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gwolfe>","xFolder":"\\ExMerge - Scholtes, Diana\\FERC","xOrigin":"SCHOLTES-D","to":"alan.comnes@enron.com,tom.alonso@enron.com,ray.alvarez@enron.com,robert.badeer@enron.com,tim.belden@enron.com,f..calger@enron.com,paul.choi@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,m..driscoll@enron.com,mark.fischer@enron.com,h..foster@enron.com,mark.guzman@enron.com,tim.heizenrader@enron.com,paul.kaufman@enron.com,holli.krebs@enron.com,elliot.mainzer@enron.com,chris.mallory@enron.com,john.malowney@enron.com,susan.mara@enron.com,matt.motley@enron.com,dave.perrino@enron.com,phillip.platter@enron.com,jeff.richter@enron.com,stewart.rosman@enron.com,diana.scholtes@enron.com,chris.stokley@enron.com,steve.swain@enron.com,mike.swerzbin@enron.com,kate.symes@enron.com,bill.williams@enron.com,greg.wolfe@enron.com"}

{"rawContent":"\nToday's FERC meeting was a big deal.   Some of the key actions are:\n\nDSTAR and RTO West are to be \"married,\"  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can \"heal its wounds.\" \nEvery utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date).  Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized.\nThe commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs.   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure.  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs.  Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation.\nAlthough California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO.\nSeparately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates.   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.\n\nFurther summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided below:\n\nAlan Comnes\n\n\nThe Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).\n\nRTOs \n\nChairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.\n\nOrganizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to \"marry up,\" meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.\n\nStructural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an \"RTO week\" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.\n\nWood also recognized that some \"sticks\" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these \"sticks\" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.\n\nWith regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how \"FERC can get there.\"  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.\n\nWhile Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.\n\nUpcoming Dates\n\n\tOctober 15-19 --\tRTO Workshops\n\tEnd of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs\n\tDecember 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked\n\n\nProposed Rule for Standards of Conduct\n\nWithin the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\"NOPR\") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.\n\nThe NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.  \n\nThere was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.\n\nProvision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)\n\nChairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.  \n\nAfter the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).  \n\nCommissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.  \n\nRealizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.\n\nSorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.\n\nSarah\n","content":"\nToday's FERC meeting was a big deal.

I also made talked with some of the people who have been participants in the development of the new standard, to check on my understanding and ask a few follow-up questions.\n\nWhile on its face, the reserve requirements are being lowered the standard is actually being tightened, because the new standard deals with the locations at which reserves are covered.  In the past, a party could carry all of its spin on a single unit.  The new standard is based on governor responses to frequency excursion.  It requires that the reserve be spread across more units or that special control features be added to AGC to allow carrying more reserves on some machines.  \n\nAs Dick indicated in his note, there is some potential for a reduction in system transfer capability.  For instance, carrying more reserves on NW hydro units in some hydrological conditions has the potential to reduce the Pacific Intertie rating by up to 20%.  However, given the limited reserves available in California, we are probably already in this condition.  With California at 1.5% reserve, there is a concern that the rating is already impacted.  On the other hand, when more generation comes on-line in California with new construction, then the reserve levels rise and the impact on transfer capability is mitigated.  \n\nThe other effect of this change is that it reduces the amount of Frequency Response Reserve (FRR) that California has to buy.  Whether the change in the responsibility to buy actually changes to pattern of reserves on machines cannot be determined at present.  However the change does have financial benefits to those who are chronically short of FRR.\n\nFinally, I wondered how the shift to from individual control areas to a single control area with the formation of RTO West would affect the reserve requirements, since the new standard talks about carrying reserves by control area or reserve sharing pool.  I was reminded that the Northwest is a reserve sharing pool.  Since , the Northwest Power Pool and RTO West represent essentially the same portion of the system.  the RTO formation will not result in a major change in requirements.  \n\nIf you have additional questions, I will dig deeper.\n\nSteve\n","content":"\nfyi\n","messageId":"<33276757.1075840021166.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-04-04T06:32:00+05:30","from":"tim.belden@enron.com","subject":"WSCC Reserve Standard","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Tim Belden <Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT>","xTo":"Jeff Richter <Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT>, Phillip Platter <Phillip Platter/HOU/ECT@ECT>, Chris Mallory <Chris Mallory/PDX/ECT@ECT>, Sean Crandall <Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT>, Diana Scholtes <Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECT>, Robert Badeer <Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT>, Lisa Gang <Lisa Gang/PDX/ECT@ECT>, Mark Fischer <Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT>, Tom Alonso <Tom Alonso/PDX/ECT@ECT>, Tim Belden <Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT>, Jeremy Morris <Jeremy Morris/PDX/ECT@ECT>, Holden Salisbury <Holden Salisbury/PDX/ECT@ECT>, Cara Semperger <Cara Semperger/PDX/ECT@ECT>, Mike Purcell <Mike Purcell/PDX/ECT@ECT>, Stacy Runswick <Stacy Runswick/PDX/ECT@ECT>","xFolder":"\\ExMerge - Scholtes, Diana\\Fundementals","xOrigin":"SCHOLTES-D","to":"jeff.richter@enron.com,phillip.platter@enron.com,chris.mallory@enron.com,sean.crandall@enron.com,diana.scholtes@enron.com,robert.badeer@enron.com,lisa.gang@enron.com,mark.fischer@enron.com,tom.alonso@enron.com,tim.belden@enron.com,jeremy.morris@enron.com,holden.salisbury@enron.com,cara.semperger@enron.com,mike.purcell@enron.com,stacy.runswick@enron.com"}

{"rawContent":"\nBob,\n \nI appreciate your input.\n \nThe OC Steering Committee has asked us to become more effective. We need to do our best to satisfy their request.\n \nOur goal is to ensure we get the best product in the most efficient manner we can. ISAS has always had voting members. These members have determined the outcome of issues that the group is responsible for. I believe the current voting structure of ISAS is typical of the Operations Committee and the Sub-committees reporting to the OC. An OC member has the ability to appoint one representative from his/her company. In at least one case in the WSCC, an individual company has two OC members. One member represents the transmission/reliability side and one member represents the merchant side. \n \nDiverse opinions often lead to the best decisions. The intent of focusing on the voting members is to make the most of the limited time we have to make decisions. Non-voting members will still have the ability to take the floor to voice their views. However, the discussion will be limited so that we can complete our business. I suggest that we see how the February meeting goes. We can discuss proposed changes to the format prior to the next meeting. However, these changes must still comply with WSCC guidelines and OC direction.\n \nThe Joint Guidance Committee is currently revising the \"Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees, Work Groups And Task Forces.\"\nThe proposed revision is attached.\n \nThanks.\n \n \n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Winn, Robert [mailto:RWINN@pnm.com]\nSent: Wednesday, January 30, 2002 1:03 PM\nTo: 'sccobb@srpnet.com'; ISAS Correspondents\nSubject: RE: ISAS Meeting Agenda 2/14&15/2002\n\n\n\nSteve, \n  \n\nWe have some concerns regarding the format you suggest for the upcoming ISAS meeting which consists of the agenda and discussion being driven primarily by the voting member.  As you know in PNM's case (and others) we have only one WSCC membership. Our Merchant and Reliability functions are still under the same company as required by current laws and regulations.  We do however operate as totally independent shops thus having different tasks, issues, insights and etc.  Neither shop is able to sufficiently represent the issues of the other.  \n\nWe are concerned that by limiting discussions to only \"the voting member\" much insight will be lost.   We would be interested in hearing from both sides of a company on issues.  I would suggest this committee consider structuring discussion and voting privileges along the lines of those being set up in other industry forums {ESC, GISB, NAERO, NAESB and etc.} where a company represented in WSCC would have voting/discussion privileges for representatives from each business sector.  In WSCC that should include at least a Reliability and/or a Merchant rep.(if applicable) even if the company holds only one WSCC membership.  \n\nI do understand and support the need to control the size of this meeting and would not want to see decisions made strictly from votes by those in attendance. We feel it very important to have fair representation in the subcommittee of all concerned entities.  \n\nI have been trying to find someone at WSCC who is involved with revision of the document titled \"Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees, Work Groups And Task Forces\" which you indicated was being revised.

We need to do our best to satisfy their request.\n \nOur goal is to ensure we get the best product in the most efficient manner we can. ISAS has always had voting members. These members have determined the outcome of issues that the group is responsible for. I believe the current voting structure of ISAS is typical of the Operations Committee and the Sub-committees reporting to the OC. An OC member has the ability to appoint one representative from his/her company. In at least one case in the WSCC, an individual company has two OC members. One member represents the transmission/reliability side and one member represents the merchant side. \n \nDiverse opinions often lead to the best decisions. The intent of focusing on the voting members is to make the most of the limited time we have to make decisions. Non-voting members will still have the ability to take the floor to voice their views. However, the discussion will be limited so that we can complete our business. I suggest that we see how the February meeting goes. We can discuss proposed changes to the format prior to the next meeting. However, these changes must still comply with WSCC guidelines and OC direction.\n \nThe Joint Guidance Committee is currently revising the \"Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees, Work Groups And Task Forces.\"\nThe proposed revision is attached.\n \nThanks.\n \n \n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Winn, Robert [mailto:RWINN@pnm.com]\nSent: Wednesday, January 30, 2002 1:03 PM\nTo: 'sccobb@srpnet.com'; ISAS Correspondents\nSubject: RE: ISAS Meeting Agenda 2/14&15/2002\n\n\n\nSteve, \n  \n\nWe have some concerns regarding the format you suggest for the upcoming ISAS meeting which consists of the agenda and discussion being driven primarily by the voting member.  As you know in PNM's case (and others) we have only one WSCC membership. Our Merchant and Reliability functions are still under the same company as required by current laws and regulations.  We do however operate as totally independent shops thus having different tasks, issues, insights and etc.  Neither shop is able to sufficiently represent the issues of the other.  \n\nWe are concerned that by limiting discussions to only \"the voting member\" much insight will be lost.   We would be interested in hearing from both sides of a company on issues.  I would suggest this committee consider structuring discussion and voting privileges along the lines of those being set up in other industry forums {ESC, GISB, NAERO, NAESB and etc.} where a company represented in WSCC would have voting/discussion privileges for representatives from each business sector.  In WSCC that should include at least a Reliability and/or a Merchant rep.(if applicable) even if the company holds only one WSCC membership.  \n\nI do understand and support the need to control the size of this meeting and would not want to see decisions made strictly from votes by those in attendance. We feel it very important to have fair representation in the subcommittee of all concerned entities.  \n\nI have been trying to find someone at WSCC who is involved with revision of the document titled \"Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees, Work Groups And Task Forces\" which you indicated was being revised.  I have not been able to find out who this person is and am unable to find anything about it on the WSCC web site...could you provide a name?  As you know, this document has not been modified since 1991.  We would like to make sure the revisions reflect the needs of all the industry as we know it today.

My\ncontrol area, too, is not prepared to change check-out and accounting\nprocedures suggested in the CACTF's work.\n\nPerhaps, embedded in the 1.7 registry tables there are pointer's to/from TPs\nto/from CAs and this is why intermediate CAs are optional in OATI's tag\nagent.  However, as you point out, there is not a one-to-one correspondence\nof TP to CA or vice-versa within the WSCC.  I hope that there are experts\nout there that can answer this item and tell us every thing is going to be\nall right.\n\nItems 2 & 3 seem to touch on a current debate going on in the NERC IS and\nTISWG email forums on extensions of tags.  From those discussions, one thing\nseems to be clear, once a tag reaches its stop hour and that transaction\nends, it is considered finished or in 1.7 speak, Dead.

On the section of the tag where the PSE creates the Physical Path\nfor the transaction, there are required fields for the Generating\nControl Area, the Load Control Area, and the intermediate Transmission\nProviders.  There is not a requirement to document the intermediate\nControl Areas (there is a location to include them as Scheduling\nEntities, but those fields are optional).  This would seem to be a\nsignificant obstacle to providing all Control Areas the information they\nneed to perform hourly schedule checks with their neighboring Control\nAreas.  Also, in WSCC, where certain Control Areas are responsible for\nmanaging constrained paths, this would be an obstacle in determining\nscheduled flows across the constrained paths.  It is possible (even\nlikely) to create tags where the Control Area would not see the tag,\nbecause the transmission used is owned by Transmission Providers other\nthan the Control Area.  Was it the intent of the NERC E-Tag 1.7\nSpecification to remove intermediate Control Areas from visibility and\napproval of the tags?\n\n2. Once an E-Tag has been approved, and has achieved the Implement\nstate, it appears to have immortality.  Even when the 'final hour' of\nthe current version of the tag has passed, the tag does not appear to be\ninactive; it is available for the creating PSE to access and extend by\nan Adjust request.   This feature could potentially bog our system down\nwith numerous tags that are presently 'inactive' but always available\nfor adjusting.  Did the NERC specifications intend for an Implemented\ntag to eventually become 'inactive' and unavailable for adjustment?\n\n3. A related concern to tag Adjustment Requests; under E-Tag 1.7, a PSE\nmay now create a tag and accomplish ongoing scheduling through the\nExtension of the tag by adjusting (oh, boy, account number scheduling\nhas returned).  At the NERC E-Tag 1.7 Training Workshop, the Timing\nRequirement for Profile Changes, WSCC, is 15 minutes to evaluate any\nearly notice.  This could be a significant business change; the PSE can\naccomplish preschedule functions by requesting tag extensions (15\nminutes evaluation time) rather than creating new tags (3 hour\nevaluation time).   The clear distinction between Next Day schedules and\nReal Time schedules is being lost.  Perhaps the evaluation time of an\nany Profile Change Request could be linked directly to the impact time\nof that change request, similar to the timing requirements for\nsubmission and evaluation of New Tag Requests.\n\nConsidering the above shortcomings, especially item #1, it is\nimpossible for us to move toward implementation of E-Tag 1.7, for, we\nwill not be able to  check out the net interchange with our neighboring\ncontrol areas or be able to manage the constrained paths in our control\narea.

This could be a significant business change; the PSE can\naccomplish preschedule functions by requesting tag extensions (15\nminutes evaluation time) rather than creating new tags (3 hour\nevaluation time).   The clear distinction between Next Day schedules and\nReal Time schedules is being lost.  Perhaps the evaluation time of an\nany Profile Change Request could be linked directly to the impact time\nof that change request, similar to the timing requirements for\nsubmission and evaluation of New Tag Requests.\n\nConsidering the above shortcomings, especially item #1, it is\nimpossible for us to move toward implementation of E-Tag 1.7, for, we\nwill not be able to  check out the net interchange with our neighboring\ncontrol areas or be able to manage the constrained paths in our control\narea. Please give me a call should you have any question or if you want\nto discuss this further.  Thanks.  \n\nRaymond \n(970) 461-7379\n\nRaymond R.

Schedule strips only get created for deals 2 days before day of flow.  So, based on the current design, the date range, at least looking forward, would only be a couple of days.\n- Option 1:  Maybe, instead of zeroing out schedules, we should adjust the dates on the deal.  This would prevent schedule strips from even being created after a certain date?\n\n2.

{"rawContent":"\nMike McDonald and I met with WAPA and the Bureau of Reclamation on Tuesday (7/17) and learned some interesting information about their relationship with PG&E.  On Oct 28th PG&E filed to change the nature of the interconnect and banking agreement with WAPA.  Currently PG&E looks at the imbalance energy (positive or negative) at the end of the month and then figures out what charges are due either party.  The imbalance account is calculated by aggregating MWHrs for the entire month.  As a result, WAPA would have a deficit in the account and then deposit a huge amount of off peak energy to balance out.\n\nAs of OCt 28th all this changes - WAPA has to submit a balanced schedule on an hourly basis or else be subject to PG&E imbalance prices (which are probably a combination of contracts and spot prices).  I believe this means that WAPA is going to have to be more diligent about its forcasts and more active in the real time and preschedule markets.

Under Section 4(d) of the Project\nAct, the only requirements seem to be that the customer be (1) a public\nbody or cooperative that is (2) \"within economic transmission distance\nof the Bonneville project.\"  Although the Northwest Power Act\nincorporates the Project Act, I do not see that it limits this\neligibility to publics in the the Columbia river drainage basin.  \n\nCan any public body or cooperative that is \"within economic transmission\ndistance of the Bonneville project,\" i.e., California, New Mexico,\nArizona, become a BPA preference customer?\n\n3.

In addition, it noted that light-handed regulation of gas pipelines has been a big factor in passing through lower commodity costs to consumers. \n\nIn short, the study reveals that the gas deregulation skeptics of the 1970s and early 1980s \"were wrong by a long shot,\" according to CAEM. \n\n\"What we also need to recognize is that we've witnessed a re-distribution of wealth from foreign oil producers to domestic natural gas producers, and that these lower prices have contributed measurably to a more stable inflation rate, lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved our [national] security due to a reduced reliance on imported oil,\" said Malloy, who formerly was on the staff at FERC and the U.S. Energy Department. \n\nThe study, entitled \"California Here We Come: The Lessons Learned from Natural Gas Deregulation,\" offers much guidance for the energy markets in the western state: 1) put the right regulatory framework in place, half measures are more dangerous than doing nothing; 2) don't expect results overnight, stay the course; 3) markets do work, and consumers and the environment will be winners under properly executed reform; 4) the costs of change are easier to calculate than the benefits; all the studies about gas deregulation underestimated the benefits; and 5) organized consumer advocates are often very wrong about the impact changes will have on consumers. \n\n","content":"\nSince Alan is on vacation I thought I would distribute this message.

The deal number that would be relevant to Real Time in this case would be the purchase (855033, not 855032). That way we can link our real time sales to the day-ahead purchase in Deal Scheduling. Also, Diana confirmed that this length should be sold off @ Mid-Columbia, not PGE System, which is not what is shown in Enpower. \n\n2.

The relevant deal number here would be 855044 - again, we only need to know the deal number that corresponds with your position. Also, since anything that alludes to the wrong hours, delivery point, or deal number only serves to confuse the traders on shift, I was thinking it might work better if we sat down and went over these positions together before sending anything out to the group.

(This is what I do with Holden when STSW does lending or parking deals.)\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this, or any suggestions about how to make this work more smoothly.\n\nThanks,\nKate \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tCutsforth, Diane  \nSent:\tFriday, November 02, 2001 1:24 PM\nTo:\tDL-Portland Real Time Shift; Alport, Kysa\nSubject:\tFW: Midc long 11-4\nImportance:\tHigh\n\nForgot the light load on Monday and deal numbers - \nThe deal number is 855032.1 for Sunday the 4th 7-22 Heavy Load  Hours only.  \n\nThe deal numbers for the 53 MWH on light load for Monday is 854942.1/855044.1 - please supply at PGE System.\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tCutsforth, Diane  \nSent:\tFriday, November 02, 2001 1:17 PM\nTo:\tDL-Portland Real Time Shift; Alport, Kysa\nSubject:\tMidc long 11-4\nImportance:\tHigh\n\nFor November 4th, Midc HL hours 7-22 only, we are 50 long, please supply at PGE system.\n\nDiane Cutsforth\nEnron North America\nPower Pre-Scheduling\n503-464-3831 desk","messageId":"<31291190.1075840026747.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-11-06T03:00:38+05:30","from":"diana.scholtes@enron.com","subject":"FW: Midc long 11-4","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Scholtes, Diana </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DSCHOLT>","xTo":"Semperger, Cara </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Csemper>","xFolder":"\\ExMerge - Scholtes, Diana\\Sent Items","xOrigin":"SCHOLTES-D","to":"cara.semperger@enron.com"}

These 5 projects are owned and controlled by 3 control areas - Douglas County PUD, Chelan County PUD and Grant County PUD. Some of the generation from these 5 projects has been sold on a long-term basis to several participants. I'm not familiar with the term \"take away rights\", but every mwh generated at these 5 projects is either used for load in the 3 control areas or it is moved away to participant's control areas. The fact that some want to represent their share of generation as being part of a \"single bus\" and claiming it can be moved away without naming a transmission provider does not accurately represent the transfer of energy from one control area to another. Douglas, Chelan and Grant are the only control areas at the Mid-Columbia with other adjacent control areas.\n\nEach participant has transmission capability (either their own or purchased) to transfer their share of generation from one of our control areas to their own.

I am very appreciative of the efforts of our Origination an=\r\nd Middle Marketing team that has made this happen.\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, I remain optimistic that someone will buy or fund the N=\r\north America gas and power businesses.  While it is impossible to handicap =\r\nanything these days with Enron I am seeing some very positive signs on this=\r\n front.  Unlike the Dynegy deal, which required Dynegy to purchase the very=\r\n profitable core business along along with the rest of Enron's baggage, the=\r\n deals being considered now would likely involve only the core business.  I=\r\n don't know whether these deals happen, and if they do, I don't know what f=\r\norm the core business takes as a result.  Chris Calger and I have been part=\r\n of the team talking to our potential suitors.  We will both be in Houston =\r\nthrough the weekend and into early next week working on this.  We will upda=\r\nte people as soon as possible as things unfold.\r\n\r\nI know that this situation really sucks.  Given the anxiety and uncertainty=\r\n that we are all feeling people are doing a great job keeping focused and s=\r\ntaying positive.  I think that things are going to unfold very quickly from=\r\n here -- most likely in the next week or two.  Please hang in there.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n(on behalf of Tim and Chris)","messageId":"<32578920.1075863608749.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-12-01T04:43:04+05:30","from":"diana.scholtes@enron.com","subject":"FW: Update","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"quoted-printable","xFrom":"Scholtes, Diana </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DSCHOLT>","xTo":"'premierpumpcompany@home.com'","xFolder":"\\ExMerge - Scholtes, Diana\\Sent Items","xOrigin":"SCHOLTES-D","to":"premierpumpcompany@home.com"}

Schedule strips only get created for deals 2 days before day of flow.

It is a suggested revision to the\nNERC A3A1 time table for the WSCC.  Some basic points are:\n\n*\tElimination of manually setting the WSCC pre-schedule flag.  The\ntable provides rules for the e-tag software to automatically set the flag.\n\n*\tThe majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive\nmechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment.  The team\nagreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one (i.e.,\ntags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee - tags\nsubmitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee - approval\nentities would receive compensation for assessing/approving late tags,\netc.).  But, a financial mechanism would  have to go through a cumbersome\nreview/approval process which would be too inflexible for the fast paced\nworld of E-Tag and NERC's electronic scheduling.  So, the suggested\nincentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved the closer\nthe submittal time is to the start time.  To do this, we considered three\nparameters - the assessment window, deferred denial, and the default\ncomposite status.  \n\n\t*\tThe assessment window is a period time that the E-Tag\nAuthority Service gives the Approval Services to assess a submitted tag.\nEach Approval Service is to check the tag for various things and respond\nwith a approved or denied vote back to Authority service who then set the\nfinal composite status.\n\n\t*\tDeferred denial is when a entity denies a tag, the composite\nstatus does not immediately become Denied, but instead waits until the end\nof the assessment window to set the composite status.  This allows the\ndenying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it, if\nappropriate.\n\n\t*\tThe default composite status is a final stated reached at\nthe end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to\nactively approve or deny a tag.  Currently, tags submitted before a certain\ndeadline will have their final composite status default to Approved.  Tags\nsubmitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status\ndefault to Denied.\n\n\tFor real-time tagging, we cite the hour-ahead business where\nPurchasing-selling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour.  \n\n\t*\tTags submitted in the first half of the hour-ahead, referred\nto 0 to 30 past, will have a 10 minute assessment window, are subjected to\ndeferred denial, and will default to Approved/Conditional.\n\n\t*\tTags submitted from 30 to 40 past, will have a 10 minute\nassessment window, are not subjected to deferred denial (can be called\ninstant denial), and but will still default to Approved/Conditional.\n\n\t*\tTags submitted in the after 40 past, will have a 5 minute\nassessment window, are not subjected to deferred denial (can be called\ninstant denial), and will default to Denied (thus assigned a composite\nstatus of Late).\n\n*\tThe table references specific times in the submittal and assessment\nprocess which should all reference a consistent time zone standard.  The\nteam was divided on the best approach.  Some suggested all times on the\ntable be the prevailing time for the LCA.  This would require each CA to\ninclude in the e-tag registry their time zone.  Some suggested  all times on\nthe table be in Pacific Prevailing Time.  And some suggested that all times\non the table be in Pacific Standard Time.  The conclusion is that a white\npaper would be produced prior to the July ISAS meeting discussing the pros\nand cons of each suggestion.\n\n*\tThe group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag\nagent's time clock - submittal time should stay with the authority service.\n\n*\tHere's a big one - because the timing table allows for later\nsubmittal times, the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of\nthe WSCC standard ramp (i.e., currently starts at 10 minutes before the\nhour).  We are recommending that ISAS request the OC to study the\nfeasibility of moving the WSCC standard ramp from a twenty minute duration\nstraddling the hour to 10 minute duration straddling the hour (i.e., starts\nat 0:55 and ends at 0:05).  Such a change would align the WSCC with the\nEastern Interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag\nsubmittals.\n\n*\tThere was some discussion on establishing a new regional practice\nfor the tariff deadline for schedule changes (most are set to 20 before the\nstart).  It was felt that there is little chance at getting all entities to\nchange their tariffs in a coordinated and timely manner.\n\n*\tThe team did not want to address at this time issues concerning\nmultiple preschedule days and how they are not recognized in Policy 3 or the\nE-Tag specifications.\n\n*\tFinally, the team can not stress enough that a composite status of\nLate should not and does not mean automatic denial.  The Late designation\nsimple indicates that the default composite status is Denied.  Approval\nentities should make every effort to assess all tags, Late or not.\n\nHurray for the team members, many, many thanks.\n\n <<tag time table draft_rev3.doc>> \n\nRobert Harshbarger\nPuget Sound Energy\nOASIS Trading Manager\n425.882.4643 (desk)\n206.604.3251 (cell)","content":"\nAttached is an Agenda (rough), the POR/POD/JOU/Tie Matrix Spreadsheet, the\nOC Handbook practices and procedures (labeled MarkHackneyOCHandbook...),\nanother copy of the Bob Harshbarger note.

The contract is under the WSPP.  Call Mallory (3811) to sell in California, Crandall (3815) or Scholtes (3807) for NW, and Salisbury (3910) for SW.  If you have any legal questions, call Dale Rasmussen (8863).\n\nBest, \n\nSteve\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dunton, Heather \nSent: Monday, January 28, 2002 9:54 AM\nTo: Hall, Steve C.
