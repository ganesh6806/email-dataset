Going forward, I will partner with \nthe PRC Representatives and Human Resources to work through our mid-year and \nyear-end performance management process.   \n\nThere are just a few remaining tasks necessary in order to bring our mid-year \neffort to a close.  As we are getting inquiries from Supervisors, Associates \nand Analysts regarding mid year ratings, we strongly encourage you to \ncommunicate final ratings to the Supervisors by no later than Friday, August \n11, 2000.    As was discussed in the PRC meetings in July, Managers have been \ngiven until September 15 to conduct performance reviews.    If you need our \nassistance in communicating information to the Supervisors, please let me \nknow and we will provide ratings where requested on your behalf.\n\nAdditionally, as we introduced a new process during our mid year review \nefforts, it is crucial that we solicit your feedback.   To assist in this \neffort, we have identified an Associate and Analyst PRC Project Team.    \nPlease look for an evaluation form via email in the next several weeks that \nrequests feedback on how well we delivered our mid year process and how we \nmight improve.  We our counting on your partnership and candid feedback.   \n\nOnce again, the Associate and Analyst Program Management Team would like to \nthank you for your involvement in the performance review process.  I can be \nreached at 713-853-7351.  My assistant is Constance Charles and she can be \nreached at 713-853-5614.

When opening dates are more clearly \ndefined\nand we have confidence in energy curves for those markets, then we could \nrevisit this\narea of your energy profile. \n\nNatural Gas:\nBunge has taken the initiative to engage in several longer term supply and \ntransporation \nagreements which have effectively managed your price/therm.  For those \nreasons, the \nopportunities are very limited for Enron to apply a consolidation approach \nand provide\ncompelling additional value for Bunge.\n\nAs we agreed in January, the first objective was to define the potential for \nmutual value\nand then decide what, if any next steps were appropriate.  I regret we will \nnot be able to\nhelp Bunge at this time, but know that Enron will remain interested in \nassisting your\ncompany in the future if and when market conditions afford us that \nopportunity.  \n\nPlease feel free to contact me at any time in the future if I can help answer \nfurther questions\nfor you or others who have been involved in this process.  Dick, thank you \nagain for \nproviding your time and attention to this inquiry process.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nGary Mirich\n\n\n\n\n","content":"\nThat's too bad.  i am sure you learned a lot from the experience which will \nserve you well on the next one.

These events include \ncustomer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  \n\nENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this \nmemo.\n\nThe $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the \nthreshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to \n$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.\n\nPlease be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and \nevents, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.\n\n1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer \nevents with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events \nwith anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public \nRelations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman\n\n2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract \nnegotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department \nwill work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they \ncan provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department \nwill be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program \nand ENA.\n\n3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting \ndocumentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a \ndetailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please \nsubmit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR \ndepartment at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the \nform.\n\n4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of \nthe Chairman for final approval.\n\nAdditionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for \nvarious local sporting events and concerts.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance \nplanning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie \nHitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.\n\n\n","content":"\nwe need to make sure we go through this approval for Tammy's upcoming \nmeeting. \n","messageId":"<3451740.1075858423269.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2000-07-11T14:31:00+05:30","from":"scott.neal@enron.com","subject":"ENA Meeting and Event Expenditure Approval Process","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Scott Neal","xTo":"Kimberly Brown","xFolder":"\\Scott_Neal_Jun2001\\Notes Folders\\Sent","xOrigin":"Neal-S","xFileName":"sneal.nsf","to":"kimberly.brown@enron.com"}

{"rawContent":"\nriday July 7, 11:43 am Eastern Time\n\nCompany Press Release\n\nSOURCE: Columbia Gas Transmission\n\nColumbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction\nProcess With FERC\n\nFAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative \nregulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity\nauction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process.\n\nIn a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for \nselling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems. \nThe filing\nwas made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is \nconsistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which\nencourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches'' \nto capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637,\nColumbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance \nfiling made June 15.\n\n``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party \nthat places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of\nRates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we \nconduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often\nwait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current \nprocess is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the \nauction is\nclosed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.''\n\nAccording to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving \nto an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes into\nconsideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in \ncapacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term\ncontracts.\n\nUnder Columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, Columbia would ``offer'' (via \nits electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm \ncapacity.\nCustomers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the \nquantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discounted\ncapacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if \nColumbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with \na\ndifferent term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a \npresent value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time \nbefore a\nbinding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.\n\nColumbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles \noutlined in FERC's Order 637. \n\n    *     Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will\n          begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be\n          posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST).\n    *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non-\n          discriminatory basis.\n    *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing\n          EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be\n          made available on the Internet.\n    *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since\n          bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to\n          each capacity package made available.\n    *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's\n          identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection\n          criteria were applied.\n    *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all\n          bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to\n          all bidders through an Internet-based system.\n\n\n``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity \nauction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all \nparties\nas well as innovative in design,'' Levander said.\n\nLevander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is \nbased on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for\ntransparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to \nwithdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.\n\nColumbia Gas Transmission, with offices in Charleston, W.Va., and Fairfax, \nVa., moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to\nmarkets along a 12,550-mile pipeline network, which reaches across 10 \nMidwestern, Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The company operates one\nof the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over 240 \nbillion cubic feet (Bcf) of working capacity.\n\nColumbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading \nenergy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its\noperating companies engage in nearly all phases of the natural gas business, \nincluding exploration and production, transmission, storage and distribution,\nas well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum product sales, and \nelectric power generation.

Since the filing is not required under Order 637,\nColumbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance \nfiling made June 15.\n\n``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party \nthat places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of\nRates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we \nconduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often\nwait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current \nprocess is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the \nauction is\nclosed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.''\n\nAccording to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving \nto an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes into\nconsideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in \ncapacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term\ncontracts.\n\nUnder Columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, Columbia would ``offer'' (via \nits electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm \ncapacity.\nCustomers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the \nquantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discounted\ncapacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if \nColumbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with \na\ndifferent term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a \npresent value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time \nbefore a\nbinding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.\n\nColumbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles \noutlined in FERC's Order 637. \n\n    *     Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will\n          begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be\n          posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST).\n    *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non-\n          discriminatory basis.\n    *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing\n          EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be\n          made available on the Internet.\n    *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since\n          bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to\n          each capacity package made available.\n    *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's\n          identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection\n          criteria were applied.\n    *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all\n          bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to\n          all bidders through an Internet-based system.\n\n\n``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity \nauction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all \nparties\nas well as innovative in design,'' Levander said.\n\nLevander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is \nbased on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for\ntransparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to \nwithdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.\n\nColumbia Gas Transmission, with offices in Charleston, W.Va., and Fairfax, \nVa., moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to\nmarkets along a 12,550-mile pipeline network, which reaches across 10 \nMidwestern, Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The company operates one\nof the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over 240 \nbillion cubic feet (Bcf) of working capacity.\n\nColumbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading \nenergy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its\noperating companies engage in nearly all phases of the natural gas business, \nincluding exploration and production, transmission, storage and distribution,\nas well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum product sales, and \nelectric power generation.

In September we will declare the viability of the project and then\ncreate a (separate) Venezuelan LNG company (to run it). The milestone is\nDecember,\" Marsicobetre said.\n\nThe Paria plant was expected to be operational by 2005, he said, adding that\nthe consortium hoped to explore further oil and gas in the Orinoco delta\nplatform, south of Trinidad, to add a second and third train to the plant. \"In\nAugust a decision will be taken by the shareholders,\" he said.\n\nPDVSA would supply associated gas to the Jose plant, in which it would also be\na shareholder. The facility aimed to export mainly to the Caribbean and the\nUnited States, he said.\n\nThe Paria plant was designed to export LNG to the north-east United States,\nSpain and Portugal.\n\nMarsicobetre said PDVSA Gas was seeking between $6 billion and $10 billion in\nprivate investment to develop the production of non-associated gas, its LNG\nprojects and the Venezuelan gas grid.\n\nExpanding non-associated gas and the gas grid would each absorb 30 percent of\nthat total sum while the two LNG facilities would need some $2.6 million. The\ncost of developing oil and gas production in the delta platform was not\nincluded in that calculation, PDVSA Gas executive Nelson Mava told reporters.\n\n\"If we move in a fast track we can have twice that investment,\" Mava said.\n\nHe said Venezuela, the world's seventh largest gas producer with proven\nreserves of 146 trillion cubic feet (tcf), was counting on the development of\nnon-associated gas to meet rising domestic demand.\n\nVenezuelan gas consumption was forecast to more than double by 2009, rising to\n4.2 billion cubic feet a day from the current level of 1.8 billion. That meant\nthe percentage of gas in the fuel mix would rise to 55 percent from 42, Mava\nsaid.\n\nOf the current 142 tcf output, 132 tcf was associated and 14 non-associated.\nBut there were unexplored reserves of non-associated gas of 6-20 tcf onshore\nand 40-60 offshore, he said.\n\n((Gillian Handyside.

For those of us who \nbelieve that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me  give you a little \nhistory lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse  than this.\n\nFor our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that  \npretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has \nhad  it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's \nfairly  concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent \ncommentaries  the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight.\n\nOver the last two quarters  the S&P 500 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has \nbeen, that actually only  ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since \n1800. Believe it or not,  there have been 77 that were worse.\n\nThere were eight six-month  periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%. \nThere were 18 in which it  lost more than 30%. The very worst single \nsix-month period was the one ending  May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an \nastonishing 52.92%.\n\nOf the 77 six-month periods  worse than the most recent one, 21 were before \n1900, and none of them were  during the Civil War. 33 (including the very \nworst 4) were in the 1930s, in the  Great Depression that followed in the \nwake of the stock market crash of 1929.  \n\nThe worst six-month period  in the modern era ranks 13th overall. It was the \none ended September, 1974, with  the S&P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the \n1970s. \n\nThe most recent period worse  than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the \none ended March, 1988, with the  S&P down 19.56%. That means that in the \n1990s there were no six-month  periods worse than the most recent six-month \nperiod. \n\nThis shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no  \nmeans as bad as it could have been, or could still be. But at the same time \nit  shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&P 500 \nhas  done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 200 \nyears. But  don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. \n\nIt can. Of the 77 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&P  went \ndown further during the next six months 24 times -- losing an  average of an \nadditional 18.24%. \n\nOkay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 \nchance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course \nthe good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things \ngetting  better. \n\nBut not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six \nmonths, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the \ncoming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the \nlast six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses.  \nIf you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents  \nleft. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. \n\nHistory class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every  \nday). \n\n - TOP.GIF\n - BOTTOM.GIF\n - audio.gif\n - vid.gif\n","content":"\n","messageId":"<22454990.1075858415392.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-04-04T15:45:00+05:30","from":"scott.neal@enron.com","subject":"bear markets","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Scott Neal","xTo":"Phillip K Allen","xFolder":"\\Scott_Neal_Jun2001\\Notes Folders\\Sent","xOrigin":"Neal-S","xFileName":"sneal.nsf","to":"phillip.allen@enron.com"}

For those of us who \nbelieve that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me  give you a little \nhistory lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse  than this.\n\nFor our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that  \npretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has \nhad  it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's \nfairly  concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent \ncommentaries  the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight.\n\nOver the last two quarters  the S&P 500 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has \nbeen, that actually only  ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since \n1800. Believe it or not,  there have been 77 that were worse.\n\nThere were eight six-month  periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%. \nThere were 18 in which it  lost more than 30%. The very worst single \nsix-month period was the one ending  May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an \nastonishing 52.92%.\n\nOf the 77 six-month periods  worse than the most recent one, 21 were before \n1900, and none of them were  during the Civil War. 33 (including the very \nworst 4) were in the 1930s, in the  Great Depression that followed in the \nwake of the stock market crash of 1929.  \n\nThe worst six-month period  in the modern era ranks 13th overall. It was the \none ended September, 1974, with  the S&P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the \n1970s. \n\nThe most recent period worse  than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the \none ended March, 1988, with the  S&P down 19.56%. That means that in the \n1990s there were no six-month  periods worse than the most recent six-month \nperiod. \n\nThis shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no  \nmeans as bad as it could have been, or could still be. But at the same time \nit  shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&P 500 \nhas  done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 200 \nyears. But  don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. \n\nIt can. Of the 77 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&P  went \ndown further during the next six months 24 times -- losing an  average of an \nadditional 18.24%. \n\nOkay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 \nchance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course \nthe good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things \ngetting  better. \n\nBut not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six \nmonths, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the \ncoming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the \nlast six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses.  \nIf you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents  \nleft. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. \n\nHistory class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every  \nday). \n\n - TOP.GIF\n - BOTTOM.GIF\n - audio.gif\n - vid.gif\n","content":"\n","messageId":"<12047327.1075858415438.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-04-04T12:40:00+05:30","from":"scott.neal@enron.com","subject":"bear markets","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Scott Neal","xTo":"Hunter S Shively","xFolder":"\\Scott_Neal_Jun2001\\Notes Folders\\Sent","xOrigin":"Neal-S","xFileName":"sneal.nsf","to":"hunter.shively@enron.com"}

I don't read it to prohibit them from buying on a \nforward basis, but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against \nthem too much.\n\nBasically, Tennessee can buy or sell gas as required to balance and to \nmaintain system integrity.  And they can buy or sell it either (1) on a first \ncome/first served basis at posted prices, (2) through an auction or gas \ntrading system, or (3) through direct negotiations.  They no longer have a \nfuel tracker.  Since they are supposed to be retaining fuel from their \ntransportation customers, they shouldn't be buying fuel, per se.  \n\nThe Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation, so \nTennessee would not be required, absent a tariff provision, to post or report \nits purchases from affiliates at the time it does them.  They do, however, \nhave to file a report of their cashout transactions, including any purchases \nthey make for balancing.

As I'm learning\nmore about options and futures in class, you're definitely right--I think\ntrading is where I want to be!\n\nThanks again and I hope to hear from you soon.  I hope all is well in\nHouston.\n\nKevin\n\n\n\n","messageId":"<25262728.1075858416222.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-03-06T17:10:00+05:30","from":"scott.neal@enron.com","subject":"Re: update","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Scott Neal","xTo":"\"Kevin B Murray\" <kmurra1@lsu.edu> @ ENRON","xFolder":"\\Scott_Neal_Jun2001\\Notes Folders\\Sent","xOrigin":"Neal-S","xFileName":"sneal.nsf","to":"kmurra1@lsu.edu"}

At midnight every night, the system checks the current \ndate and then CHANGES the dates shown on the Product Description.   For \nexample, if Product #20451 is \"Month+1\", then on Feb. 28, the Short \nDescription on the Website and in Stack Manager would show \"April1-30\".    \nHowever, on March 1, the system will automatically change the date of Product \n#20451 to show \"May1-31\".  Note that the Product number stays the same, but \nthe date has automatically updated.\n\nWhen all of your Products use Tokenized Reference Periods, this works fine - \nyour links all stay on the same relative date (links are between Product \nNumbers, not between Product Short Descriptions, so as the date changes, it \nmight look like your links are changing, but in fact they have stayed on the \nsame Product all the time - only the date changed).\n\nBelieve it or not, changing to Tokenized Reference Periods will make your \nlife easier in the long run - you will not have to continually create new \nProducts and links. Links between Products which share the same dates should \ncontinue in effect as the dates of both the Parent and Child change together.\n\nThe important thing to remember here is that for monthly Products which have \nRolling Tokenized Reference Periods, the dates will continue to change \nautomatically on the 1st day of each new month.  \n \nFor example:\n\nOn Feb. 28, the \"Prompt Month\" product will be March; but on March 1, it will \nbecome April, etc.  \nOn Feb. 28, the \"Prompt +1 Month\" product will be April; but on March 1, it \nwill become May. etc.\n\nTo verify if your product has a Tokenized Reference Period or if it has a \nspecific date, please review your product in Product Manager under the 1st \ntab marked \"Product Details.\"   Your product will be \"Tokenized\" if it has \nthe following applications:\n\nThere will be a check mark  in the box after \"Lifespan Tokenized?\"\nThe term \"Prompt Month\" or \"Prompt Month +1\" will be displayed in the next \nscroll-down box.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about the set-up of your products, please contact \nthe following members of the EnronOnline Product Control Group:\nRob Cass x 35491\nKevin Meredith   x 39555\nMelba Lozano x 58986\nChris Walker x 37533\n","content":"\n","messageId":"<4569238.1075858416266.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-03-01T13:13:00+05:30","from":"scott.neal@enron.com","subject":"NOTICE TO ALL ENRONONLINE TRADERS","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Scott Neal","xTo":"Brad McKay","xFolder":"\\Scott_Neal_Jun2001\\Notes Folders\\Sent","xOrigin":"Neal-S","xFileName":"sneal.nsf","to":"brad.mckay@enron.com"}

Therefore DTI is guaranteed Index minus gas, however must have the \nflexibility to potentially take more or less gas than the baseload quantity.  \nRemember, if the option is out of the money for the entire period, DTI will \nreceive only the baseload quantity.  If ENA exercises the option everyday \nthen DTI will receive the quantities mentioned above still at a price of \nIndex -2 cents.\n\nThis can work if you need a quantity of gas over say four months we can imbed \nthe option in three of the months and buy or sell the remainder in the fourth \nmonth at Index flat to achieve the desired quantity over the four month \nperiod.  Obviously the more flexibility you give the more premium the option \nwill generate and hence the greater the discount to Index we can guarantee. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.

If you would like me to do a \nconference call with Michelle just let me know.\n\nThanks,\nSean\n\n","messageId":"<26155841.1075858416439.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-02-27T16:14:00+05:30","from":"scott.neal@enron.com","subject":"Re: Guaranteeing Index Minus Gas","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Scott Neal","xTo":"Sean Boyle","xFolder":"\\Scott_Neal_Jun2001\\Notes Folders\\Sent","xOrigin":"Neal-S","xFileName":"sneal.nsf","to":"sean.boyle@enron.com"}

Please let \nme know if you disagree with any of the changes that were made and we will \nfix them.
